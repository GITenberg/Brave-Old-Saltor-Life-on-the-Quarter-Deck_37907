<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This volume, the sixth and last of "<span class="smcap">The Army and Navy
Stories</span>," is a record of "Life on the Quarter Deck," mostly in
the squadron of Vice Admiral Farragut, one of whose familiar
appellations, used in the ward-room and on the berth deck, has
furnished the leading title of the book. The terrible war which
devastated our country for four years has given to history two
generals, Grant and Sherman, and one admiral, Farragut, whose
achievements are unsurpassed, if they are equalled, in the annals
of military and naval warfare; but while the author, in this
work, has gratefully rendered his tribute of admiration to the
distinguished naval commander, he has not attempted to present
a complete biography of him.</p>

<p>Those who have read the preceding volumes of this series need
hardly be told that this is a book of adventure&mdash;of personal
experience in the great struggle of the nineteenth century. Jack
Somers, "The Sailor Boy," Mr. Somers, "The Yankee Middy,"
and Captain Somers, Lieutenant Commanding, are the same
person; though often as he changes his official position, he is still
the same honest, true, and Christian young man.</p>

<p>In our completed sixth volume we take leave of the Somers<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
family with many regrets. If our young friends in the army and
navy had been less true, noble, and Christian, we could have
parted with less sorrow. Yet the army and navy, as they
crushed the Rebellion, have given us many young men just as
true, just as noble and Christian. Let us gratefully cherish these
living heroes, and they will not pass away from us "like a tale
that is told."</p>

<p>To the readers, young and old, who have perseveringly followed
my heroes through the two thousand pages of this series,
I am even more than grateful; for I feel that they have sympathized
with me in my desire to present a lofty ideal to the
young man of to-day&mdash;one who will be true to God, true to
himself, and true to his country, in whatever sphere his lot may
be cast, whether on the forecastle or the quarter deck; as a
private or an officer, in the great army which must ever battle
with life's trials and temptations till the crown immortal be won.</p>

<p class="h3">LIEUTENANT PILLGRIM.</p>

<p>"Well, Prodigy, I congratulate you on your
promotion. I even agree with your enthusiastic
admirers, who say that no young
man better deserves his advancement than you," said
Miss Kate Portington, standing in the entry of her
father's house at Newport, holding Mr. Ensign John
Somers by the hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Portington," replied the young officer,
with a blush caused as much by the excitement of
that happy moment, as by the handsome compliment paid
by the fair girl, who, we are compelled to acknowledge,
had formed no inconsiderable portion of the young man's
thoughts, hopes, and aspirations during the preceding
year.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>John Somers had been examined by the board of
naval officers appointed for the purpose, had been triumphantly
passed, and promoted to the rank he now
held. A short furlough had been granted to him, and
he had just come from Pinchbrook, where he had spent a
week. A visit to Newport was now almost as indispensable
as one to the home of his childhood, and on his
way to join the ship to which he had been ordered, he
paused to discharge this pleasing duty.</p>

<p>Ensign Somers was dressed in a new uniform, and a
certain boyish look, for which he was partly indebted to
the short jacket he had worn as a midshipman, had vanished.
Perhaps Miss Portington felt that the pertness,
not to say impudence, with which she had formerly
treated him, though allowable, under a liberal toleration,
towards a boy, would hardly be justifiable in her intercourse
with a young man. Though, from the force of
habit, she called him "Prodigy," there was a certain
maidenly reserve in her manner, which rather puzzled
Somers, and he could not help asking himself what he
had done to cause this slight chill in her tones and
actions.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the frock coat which produced this
refrigerating effect; but it was a very elegant and well-fashioned
garment, having the shoulder straps on which
glistened the "foul anchor," indicating his new rank,
and each sleeve being adorned with a single gold band on<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
the cuff, also indicative of his new position. The cap,
which he now held in his hand, was decorated with a
band of gold lace, and bore on its front the appropriate
naval emblem. In strict accordance with the traditions
of the navy, he wore kid gloves, without which a naval
officer, on a ceremonial occasion, would be as incomplete
as a ship without a rudder.</p>

<p>We have no means of knowing what Mr. Ensign
Somers thought of himself in his "new rig," which certainly
fitted with admirable nicety, and gave him an appearance
of maturity which he did not possess when we
last saw him on the quarter deck of the Rosalie. We
will venture to assert, however, that he felt like a man,
and fully believed that he was one&mdash;a commendable
sentiment in a person of his years, inasmuch as, if he
feels like a man, he is the more likely to act like one.
As we can hardly suppose he soared above all the vanities
of his impressible period of life, it is more than
probable that he regarded himself as a very good looking
young fellow; which brilliant suggestion was, no doubt,
wholly or in part due to the new uniform he wore.</p>

<p>If not wholly above the weakness of a young man of
twenty, possibly he had a great deal of confidence in his
own knowledge and ability, regarded some of the veterans
of the navy as "old fogies," and looked upon his
own father as "a slow coach." But we must do Mr.
Somers the justice to say that he tried to be humble in<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
his estimate of himself, and to bear the honors he had
won with meekness; that he endeavored to crush down
and mortify that overweening self-sufficiency which distorts
and disfigures the character of many estimable
young men. His native bashfulness had, in some measure,
been overcome by his intercourse with the world,
and the humility of his nature, though occasionally assaulted
by the accident of a new coat and an extra supply
of gold lace, or by the hearty commendations of his
superiors, was genuine, and, in the main, saved him from
the besetting sin of his years.</p>

<p>Standing in the presence of Miss Kate Portington,
after an absence of several months, wearing a new coat
glittering with the laurels he had won on the bloodstained
decks of the nation's ships, he would have been
more than human if he had not felt proud of what he
was, and what he had done&mdash;proud, not vain. He was
happy, holding the hand of her who had occupied so
large a place in his thoughts, and whose image had
fringed with roseate hues his brightest hopes and strongest
aspirations.</p>

<p>Kate was not so free with him as she had been, and
her reserve annoyed and perplexed him. He had anticipated
a much warmer welcome than that which greeted
him on his arrival. He was slightly disappointed,
though there was nothing in her manner for which he
could have reproached her, even if their relations had<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
been more intimate than they were. She was less
stormy, but still gentle and kind; a little more distant
in manner, though her looks and words assured him
she regarded him with undiminished interest. Had he
known that the elegant frock coat he wore produced the
chill in the lady which so vexed and disconcerted him,
he would willingly have exchanged it for the short jacket
in which he had won his promotion.</p>

<p>They were standing in the entry. When the servant
admitted Mr. Somers, Kate had heard his voice, and
perhaps from prudential motives&mdash;for there was a visitor
in the parlor&mdash;she had preferred to meet him in the hall.</p>

<p>"You have been very fortunate, Mr. Somers," added
she, gently releasing her hand from that of the ensign.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers, instead of "Prodigy"!</p>

<p>"I have. I don't deserve my promotion, I know;
but I could not help taking it when it was within my
reach," replied Somers; and her words, though so
slightly chilled that the frigid tone could not have been
noticed by any one who did not expect an unreasonable
warmth, took half the conceit out of him, and let him
down a long reach from the high hopes and brilliant
expectations with which he had looked forward to this
meeting.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Mr. Somers, I think you deserve
even more than you have received."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Portington; you were always more
lavish of kind words than I deserved."<span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>"Why, Prodigy&mdash;"</p>

<p>She suddenly checked herself. It was evident to
Somers that she intended to say something pert or saucy.
Perhaps she choked down the impertinent words from
the fear that the honorable secretary of the navy,
if such wild and wayward young ladies as herself were
permitted to contaminate the plushy air of Newport society,
would remove the Naval Academy back to Annapolis,
where it is better to be "proper" than to be loyal.</p>

<p>"You were about to say something, Miss Portington,"
said Somers.</p>

<p>"I was, but it was saucy."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you did not say it."</p>

<p>"I am glad I did not, for you must know, Mr. Somers,
that mother has scolded me so much for being saucy,
that I have solemnly resolved to be proper in all things
henceforth and forevermore."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for it," answered Somers, with unaffected
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Sorry, you wretch?"</p>

<p>Somers laughed.</p>

<p>"There's another slip. I have done my best to reform
my life. I am afraid I shall never succeed. Now,
Prodigy&mdash;"</p>

<p>Somers laughed again.</p>

<p>"Again!" exclaimed Kate.</p>

<p>"I wish to ask one favor of you, Miss Portington."<span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p>

<p>"It would afford me more pleasure to grant it, than it
does you to ask it. Name it."</p>

<p>"That you will never call me Prodigy again."</p>

<p>"I had firmly resolved before you came never to do
it," laughed she.</p>

<p>"Well, I only asked it in order to help along your
good resolutions."</p>

<p>"Then you are making fun of me?"</p>

<p>"Like yourself, I am very serious."</p>

<p>"But I am in earnest, Mr. Somers; I mean to reform.
Now, father and mother will be very glad to see
you, Mr. Somers."</p>

<p>"Your father?"</p>

<p>"He was temporarily relieved to attend a court martial.
He is going away again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You have other visitors?"</p>

<p>"Only Lieutenant Pillgrim."</p>

<p>"I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance."</p>

<p>"He is a Virginian, I believe; at any rate he is from
the South, and has just been restored to his rank in the
navy."</p>

<p>Kate led the way into the parlor, where he was first
welcomed by her mother.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I am glad to see you, and to congratulate
you on your promotion," said the commodore, as he
grasped the hand of the young officer.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Somers. "The only ungratified<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
wish I had was that I might be appointed to your
ship."</p>

<p>"My ship!"</p>

<p>"I should have been glad to serve under so able and
distinguished a commander."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have you in my ship," promptly returned
the commodore, shaking his head energetically.</p>

<p>Somers looked abashed, and Kate wore a troubled
expression.</p>

<p>"I should endeavor to do my duty," he added.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, but I wouldn't have you in
my ship."</p>

<p>"Your remark is not very complimentary," said Somers,
his face beginning to flush with indignation at what
seemed to be an assault upon his professional character.</p>

<p>"It is the most complimentary thing I could say to
you. And I mean what I say: I wouldn't have you in
my ship."</p>

<p>"Why not, father?" demanded Kate.</p>

<p>"Because I like the young dog, and because I believe
in discipline. I never indulge in partiality on board my
ship, and it is better to keep out of temptation. I am
under obligations to you, Mr. Somers; I am happy to
acknowledge them, but they must not come between me
and duty. Mr. Somers, Lieutenant Pillgrim," continued
Commodore Portington, turning to the visitor.</p>

<p>Somers looked at the officer thus indicated, and as his<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
eyes rested upon him, he started back with a momentary
astonishment, for the face had a strange look of familiarity
to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I am happy to meet and to know you.
Your name and reputation are already familiar to me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to know you, sir," replied Somers, with
some confusion. "Your face looks so familiar to me,
that I think we must have met before."</p>

<p>"Never, to my knowledge," answered the lieutenant,
with easy self-possession.</p>

<p>"I was quite sure I had seen you before."</p>

<p>"Possibly; I do not remember it, however."</p>

<p>"If I had met you without the favor of an introduction,
I should certainly have claimed the honor of your
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I should have been proud to be so claimed, but I
must confess you would have had the advantage of me."</p>

<p>"Of course, I must be mistaken, as you suggest."</p>

<p>"It is not unlikely that we have met in some ante-room
where we were dancing attendance on the powers
that be, in search of employment; but I am quite sure,
Mr. Somers, that I should have been proud and happy
to number you among my friends."</p>

<p>"It is not too late now," said the commodore.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I should be but too happy to have
as my friend one who has served his country so faithfully,"
added Mr. Pillgrim, as he bowed gracefully to<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
Somers, "especially as I understand we are appointed
to the same ship."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I am ordered to the Chatauqua."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Pillgrim, you will take care of our Prodigy;
you will be excellent friends, I trust," said Kate,
beginning very impulsively in her old way, and suddenly
checking herself when her resolution to be "proper"
interposed itself.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Kate? Have you and Mr.
Somers had a falling out?" demanded the commodore.</p>

<p>"O, no, father."</p>

<p>"You talk as though you had had a quarrel, and for
a moment had forgotten to be savage."</p>

<p>"We have had no quarrel, pa," replied Kate, blushing.
"I was going to be saucy, but ma says I must not
be saucy, and I shall not be saucy any more. I only
hoped the two gentlemen who are going to live together
in the same ship would be good friends."</p>

<p>"Of course they will. Officers never quarrel."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they don't; but they are not always as good
friends as I hope these gentlemen will be," laughed Kate.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will be my friend for your sake, if he is
not for mine," added Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"I do not wish that. I don't like to have anybody
do anything for my sake, unless it be to take paregoric
when I am sick."<span class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>

<p>"I trust I shall not be paregoric to him," said Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Then he will not take you for my sake."</p>

<p>"As Lieutenant Pillgrim is my superior officer, I
should be likely to court his good will, and prize his
friendship very highly. If we are not friends, I am
sure it will not be my fault."</p>

<p>At this moment the dinner bell rang; and although
Somers did not feel intimate enough with the family to
invite himself to dine, he was easily prevailed upon to
remain, and gallantly gave his arm to Mrs. Portington,
as Kate, for some wayward reason of her own, had
already seized upon that of Lieutenant Pillgrim.</p>

<p>At the table Somers sat opposite the lieutenant, and
he found it impossible to avoid looking upon him with a
strange and undefinable interest. Since his first glance
at the commodore's visitor, who seemed to be on the best
of terms with the family, he had been perplexed by some
strange misgivings. He could not banish from his mind
an assurance that he had seen him before; that he had
talked with him, and even been, to some extent, intimate
with him.</p>

<p>The thought that Kate was somewhat changed in her
demeanor towards him did not contribute to increase his
satisfaction. She had contrived to take the lieutenant's
arm instead of his own, and perhaps he had come as the
successor of Phil Kennedy, who had been reputed to<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
be high in her good graces. But Mr. Pillgrim was a
gentleman of thirty-five, at least, and this was not probable,
in his view of the matter. Somers, being disinterested,
was more worried to know when, where, and
under what circumstances he had met the lieutenant.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="h3">WAITING FOR THE SHIP.</p>

<p>Somers was utterly unable to satisfy himself in
regard to Lieutenant Pillgrim. The face was
certainly familiar to him, not as a combination
of remembered features, but rather as an expression. To
him the eye seemed to be the whole of the man, and its
gaze would haunt him, though his memory refused to
identify it with any time, place, or circumstances.
Though his reason compelled him to believe that he was
mistaken, and that Mr. Pillgrim was actually a stranger,
his consciousness of having seen, and even of having been
intimate with, the gentleman, most obstinately refused to
be shaken.</p>

<p>"Of course, gentlemen, you have no idea to what point
the Chatauqua has been ordered?" said the commodore.</p>

<p>"I have not," replied Mr. Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"I have heard it said that she was going to the Gulf,"
added Somers.</p>

<p>"Very likely; there are two points where extensive
naval operations are likely to be undertaken&mdash;at Mobile<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
and at Wilmington. The rebellion has had so many
hard knocks that the bottom must drop out before many
months."</p>

<p>"I am afraid the end is farther off than most people at
the North are willing to believe," said Mr. Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Every thing looks hopeful. If we can contrive to
batter down Fort Fisher, and open Mobile Bay, the
rebels may count the months of their Confederacy on
their fingers."</p>

<p>"I think there is greater power of resistance left in
the South, than we give it the credit for."</p>

<p>"The rebels have fought well; what of it?" continued
the commodore, who did not seem to be pleased with the
style of the lieutenant's remarks.</p>

<p>"As fighting men, we can hardly fail to respect those
who have fought so bravely as the people of the South."</p>

<p>"People of the South!" sneered the commodore.
"Why don't you call them rebels?"</p>

<p>"Of course that is what I mean," answered Mr. Pillgrim,
a slight flush visible on his cheek.</p>

<p>"If you mean it, why don't you say it? Call things
by their right names. The people of the South are not
all rebels. Why, confound it, Farragut is a Southerner;
so is General Anderson; so are a hundred men, who have
distinguished themselves in putting down treason. It's
an insult to these men to talk about the people of the
South as rebels."<span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>"I agree with you, Commodore Portington, and what
I said was only a form of expression."</p>

<p>"It's a very bad form of expression. Why, man, you
are a Southerner yourself."</p>

<p>"I am; and I suppose that is what makes me so
proud of the good fighting the people of the South&mdash;I
mean the rebels&mdash;have done. We can't help respecting
men who have behaved with so much gallantry."</p>

<p>"Can't we?" exclaimed the commodore, with a sneer
so wholesome and honest, that Lieutenant Pillgrim withered
under it. "I can help it. I have no respect for
rebels and traitors under any circumstances."</p>

<p>"Nor I, as rebels and traitors," replied Pillgrim,
mildly.</p>

<p>"As rebels and traitors! I don't like these fine-spun
distinctions. If a man is a traitor, call him so, and
swing him up on the fore-yard arm, where he belongs."</p>

<p>"You are willing to acknowledge that the rebels have
fought well in this war?" added the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"They have fought well: I don't deny it."</p>

<p>"And you appreciate gallant conduct?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the cause. No, sir! I don't appreciate
gallant conduct on the part of rebels and traitors.
It is not gallant conduct; and the better they fight, the
more wicked they are."</p>

<p>"I can hardly take your view of the case."</p>

<p>"Can't you? The best fighting I ever saw in my life<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
was on the deck of a pirate ship. The black-hearted
villains fought like demons. Not a man of them would
yield the breadth of a hair. We had to cut them down
like dogs. Is piracy respectable because these men
fought well?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; but the bravery of such men&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I know what you are going to say; but
you can't separate the pirate from his piracy, nor the
traitor from his treason," replied the commodore, warmly.
"The other day I saw a little dirty urchin fighting
with his mother. The young cub had run away, I suppose,
and the woman was dragging him back to the
house. He was not more than six years old, but he
displayed a power of resistance which rather astonished
me. He kicked, bit, scratched, and yelled like a young
tiger. He called his mother everything but a lady.
The poor woman tugged at him with all her strength,
but the little rascal was almost a match for her. I
wanted to take him by the nape of the neck, and shake
the ugly out of him: nothing but my fixed principles of
neutrality prevented me from doing so. I suppose, Mr.
Pillgrim, you would have sympathized with the brat,
because he fought bravely."</p>

<p>"Hardly," replied the lieutenant, laughing at the simile.</p>

<p>"But he fought like a tiger, and displayed no mean
strategy in his rebellious warfare. Of course he was
worthy of your admiration," sneered the commodore.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>"That's hardly a fair comparison."</p>

<p>"The fairest in the world. The rebels have insulted
their own mother&mdash;the parent that fostered, protected,
and loved them. They undertook to run away from her;
and when she attempts to bring them back to their duty,
they kick, and scratch, and bite; and you admire them
because they fight well."</p>

<p>"I stand convicted, Commodore Portington. I never
took this view of the matter; I acknowledge that you
are right," said Mr. Pillgrim.</p>

<p>Somers, who had been an attentive listener to the conversation,
thought the lieutenant yielded very gracefully,
and much more readily than could have been expected;
but then the logician was a commodore, and perhaps it
was prudence and politeness on his part to agree with
his powerful superior.</p>

<p>After dinner the party took a ride to the beach and to
the Glen; and after an early tea, Somers and Pillgrim,
who were to be fellow-passengers to Philadelphia, where
the Chatauqua was fitting out, began to demonstrate in
the direction of their departure. Kate, though she had
been tolerably playful during the afternoon, had, in the
main, carried out her good resolution to be proper. She
had not been impudent&mdash;hardly pert; and deprived of
this convenient mask for whatever kindness she might
have entertained towards the young ensign, she seemed
to be very cold and indifferent to him. She was more<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
thoughtful, serious, and earnest than when they had met
on former occasions. He could not help asking himself
what he had done to produce this marked change in her
conduct.</p>

<p>"Good by, Miss Portington," said he, when he had
taken leave of her father and mother.</p>

<p>"Good by, Mr. Somers. Shall I hear from you when
you reach your station?" she asked, presenting her hand.</p>

<p>"If you desire it."</p>

<p>"If I desire it! Why, Mr. Somers, you forget that I
am deeply interested in your success."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if I do anything of which you would care to
learn, the newspapers may inform you of the fact," replied
Somers, with a kind of grim smile, which seemed
actually to alarm poor Kate.</p>

<p>"I would rather hear it from you."</p>

<p>"I judge that you are more interested in my success
than you are in me."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Somers, you cannot separate the pirate
from his piracy, pa said; nor the hero from his heroism,
let me add."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Portington."</p>

<p>"I cannot forget how deeply indebted we are to you,
Mr. Somers."</p>

<p>"I wish you could."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish so?" demanded the astonished
maiden; more astonished at his manner than his words.<span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>"I am sorry to have you burdened with such a weight
of obligation."</p>

<p>"I think you mean to quarrel with me, Mr. Somers.
I beg you will not be so savage just as you are going
away," laughed Kate, though there was a troubled expression
on her fair face. "I asked you if I should hear
from you, Mr. Somers."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you desire."</p>

<p>"Why do you qualify your words? I should be just
as glad to hear from you as I ever was."</p>

<p>"Then you shall, at every opportunity."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Somers. That sounds hearty and
honest, as father would say."</p>

<p>"I do not wish you to feel an interest in me from a
sense of duty. I shall not write any letters from a sense
of duty, or even because I have promised to do so. I
shall write to you because&mdash;because I can't help it,"
stammered Somers, almost overcome by the violence of
his exertions.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr. Somers, and I am sure your letters
will be all the more welcome from my knowledge of the
fact."</p>

<p>"Good by," said he, gently pressing the little hand he
held.</p>

<p>"Good by," she replied; and to his great satisfaction
and delight, the pressure was returned&mdash;a kind of telegraphic<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
signal, infinitely more expressive than all the
words in the spelling-book, strung into sentences, could
have been to a young man in his desperate condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Ensign Somers was now entirely satisfied. That
gentle pressure of the hand had atoned for all her reserve
and coldness, real or imaginary, and made the future
bright and pleasant to look upon. Undoubtedly Mr.
Somers was a silly young fellow; but there is some consolation
in believing that he was just like all young men
under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim followed him out of the house, and they
hastened down to the wharf to take the steamer for New
York. On the passage the two officers treated each
other with courtesy and consideration, but there appeared
to be no strong sympathy of thought or feeling between
them, and they were not drawn so closely together as
they might have been under similar circumstances, if
there had been more of opinion and sentiment common
between them.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Philadelphia, they found the Chatauqua
was still in the hands of the workmen, and would
not go into commission for a week or ten days. They
reported to the commandant of the navy yard, and took
up their quarters at the "Continental," where Somers
found his old friend Mr. Waldron, who had been detached
from the Rosalie at his own request, and ordered to
the Chatauqua, in which he was to serve as executive<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
officer. This was splendid news to Somers, for he regarded
Mr. Waldron as a true and trusty friend, in
whom he could with safety confide.</p>

<p>"Do you know Lieutenant Pillgrim?" asked Somers,
after they had discussed their joint information in regard
to the new ship.</p>

<p>"I am not personally acquainted with him, though I
have heard his name mentioned. He is a Virginian, I
think."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If I mistake not, there were some doubts about his
loyalty, though he never tendered his resignation; he has
been kept in the background."</p>

<p>"He seems to be a loyal and true man."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, or he would not have been appointed
to the Chatauqua."</p>

<p>"He has some respect for the rebels, but no sympathy."</p>

<p>"I think he has frequently applied for employment,
but has not obtained it until the present time. I have no
doubt he is a good fellow and a good officer. He ranks
next to me. But, Somers, I leave town in half an hour,"
continued Mr. Waldron, consulting his watch. "I am
going to run home for a few days, till the ship goes into
commission. I will see you here on my return."</p>

<p>Somers walked to the railroad station with his late
commander, and parted with him as the train started.
During the three succeeding days, he visited the museums,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
libraries, and other places of resort, interesting to
a young man of his tastes. He went to the navy yard
every day, and, with his usual zeal, learned what he
could of the build, rig, and armament of the Chatauqua,
and gathered such other information relating to his profession
as would be useful to him in the future.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pillgrim passed his time in a different manner.
Though he was not what the world would call an
intemperate or an immoral man, he spent many of his
hours in bar-rooms, billiard-saloons, and places of public
amusement. He several times invited Somers to "join"
him at the bar, to play at billiards, and to visit the theatre,
and other places of more questionable morality.
The young officer was not a prude, but he never drank,
did not know how to play billiards, and never visited a
gambling resort. He went to the theatre two or three
times; but this was the limit of his indulgence.</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim was courteous and gentlemanly; he did
not press his invitations. He treated his brother officer
with the utmost kindness and consideration; was always
ready, and even forward, to serve him; and their relations
were of the pleasantest character.</p>

<p>One evening, when Somers called at the office for the
key of his room, after his return from the navy yard, a
letter was handed to him. The writing was an unfamiliar
hand, scrawling and hardly legible. It was evidently
the production of an illiterate person. On reaching his
room he opened it.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE WOUNDED SAILOR.</p>

<p>The curiosity of Somers was not a little excited
before he opened the uncouth letter in his hand.
It was postmarked Philadelphia, which made its
reception all the more strange, for he had no friends or
acquaintances residing in the city. He tore open the
dirty epistle, which was not even enclosed in an envelope,
and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Phila.</span> June the 19. 1864.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Somers Esq.</span> Sir. I been wounded in the
leg up the Missippi and can not do nothing more. I
been in your division aboard the Rosalie, and I know
you was a good man and I know you was a good officer,
I hope you be in good helth, as I am not at this present
writen. my Leg is very bad, and don't git no better.
This is to inform you that I am the only son of a poor
widdow, who has no other Son, and she can not do nothing
for me, nor I can't do nothing for her. I have Fout
for my countrey and have been woundded in the servis.<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
If you could git a penshin for me. it would be a grate
help to me Sorrowin condition. I live No &mdash; Front Street.
If I might make bold to ask you to come and see a old
Sailor, thrown on the beam ends of missfortune, I would
be very thankful to you.</p>

<p class="author1">
Yours to command,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">THOMAS BARRON.</span></p>

<p>N. B. The doctor says he thinks my Leg will have
to come off.</p>

<p>Tom Longstone knows me, and you ask him, he will
tell you all About me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Thomas Barron," mused Somers, as he folded the
letter. "I don't remember him. There were two or
three Toms on board the Rosalie. At any rate, I have
nothing better to do than call upon him. He is an old
sailor, and that is enough for me."</p>

<p>It was already after dark; but he decided to visit the
sufferer that night, and after tea he left the house for
this purpose. He was sufficiently acquainted with the
streets of this systematic city to make his way without
assistance. Of course he did not expect to find the home
of the old sailor in a wealthy and aristocratic portion of
the city; but if he had understood the character of the
section to which the direction led him, he would probably
have deferred his charitable mission till the following
day. On reaching the vicinity of the place indicated, he<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
found himself in a vile locality, surrounded by the lowest
and most depraved of the population.</p>

<p>With considerable difficulty he found the number mentioned
in the letter. The lower story of the building was
occupied as a liquor shop, and a further examination of
the premises assured him the place was a sailor's boarding-house.
As this fact was not inconsistent with the
character of Tom Barron, he entered the shop. Half a
dozen vagabonds had possession; and as Somers entered,
the attention of the whole group was directed to him.</p>

<p>"Is there a sailor by the name of Thomas Barron in
this house?" asked Somers of the greasy, corpulent
woman, who stood behind about four feet of counter,
forming the bar, on which were displayed several bottles
and decanters.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and very bad he is too," replied the
woman, civilly enough, though the young officer could
hardly help shuddering in her presence.</p>

<p>"Could I see him?"</p>

<p>"I 'spect you can, if you be the officer Tom says is
comin' to see him."</p>

<p>"I am the person."</p>

<p>"Tom's very bad."</p>

<p>"So he says in his letter."</p>

<p>"He hain't had a minute's peace or comfort with that
leg sence he come home from the war. Be you any
relation of his?"<span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>"I am not."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you're his friend."</p>

<p>"He served under me in the Rosalie."</p>

<p>"Tom hain't paid no board for two months, which
comes hard on a poor woman like me, takin' care of him,
and his mother too, that come here to nuss him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps something can be done for him."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so. I don't see how I can keep him
any longer. He owes me forty dollars. If any body'll
pay half on't, I'd keep on doin' for him."</p>

<p>"I will see what can be done for him. Why was he
not sent to the hospital?"</p>

<p>"He's too bad to be sent, and he don't want to go,
nuther. He says the doctors try speriments on poor
fellers like him, and he don't want to be cut up afore
he's dead."</p>

<p>"Well, I will endeavor to have something done for
him. I am entirely willing to help him as much as I
can."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd be willin' to do sunthin' towards
payin' my bill, then."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will; but I wish to see the man before I
do anything. Will you show me to his room?"</p>

<p>"I don't go up and down stairs none now. Here,
Childs, you show this gentleman up to the front room,"
said the landlady to one of the vagabonds before her.
"Then go and tell Tom his officer has come. I suppose<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
they'll want to slick up a little, afore they let you in;
but Miss Barron will tell you when she is ready."</p>

<p>Somers followed the man up a flight of rickety stairs,
and was ushered into the front room. It was a bedchamber,
supplied with the rudest and coarsest furniture.
The visitor sat down, after telling Childs that the sailor's
mother need not stop to "slick up" before he was
admitted. He did not like the surroundings, even independent
of the villainous odors that rose from the
groggery, and those that were engendered in the apartment
where he sat. Slush and tar were agreeable perfumes,
compared with those which assaulted his sense
in this chamber; and he hoped Mrs. Barron would
humiliate her pride to an extent which would permit him
to make a speedy exit from the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barron, however, appeared not to be in a hurry,
and Somers waited ten minutes by his watch, which
seemed to expand into a full hour before he heard a
sound to disturb the monotony of the chamber's quiet.
But when it was disturbed, it was in such a manner that
he forgot all about the place and the odors, the hour and
the occasion, and even the poor sailor, who had so
piteously appealed to him for assistance.</p>

<p>In the rear of the room in which Somers sat, there
was a door communicating with another apartment.
The house was old and out of repair; and this door,
never very nicely adjusted, was now warped and thrown<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
out of place, so that great cracks yawned around the
edges, and whatever was said or done in one room, of
which any knowledge could be obtained by the sense of
hearing, was immediately patent to the occupants of the
other. Somers heard footsteps in the rear room, though
the parties appeared not to have come up the stairs by
which he had ascended. The rattling of chairs and of
glass ware next saluted his ears; but as yet Somers
had not the slightest interest in the business of the adjoining
apartment, and only wished that Mrs. Barron
would speedily complete the preparations for his reception.</p>

<p>"It's dangerous business," said one of the men in the
rear room; which remark followed a smack of the lips,
and a rude depositing of the glass on the table, indicating
that the speaker had just swallowed his dram.</p>

<p>The man uttered his remark in a loud tone, exhibiting
a strange carelessness, if the matter in hand was as dangerous
as the words implied.</p>

<p>"I know it is dangerous, Langdon," said another person,
in a voice which instantly riveted the attention of
the listener.</p>

<p>Somers heard the voice. It startled him, and he had
no eye, ear, or thought for anything but the individual
who had last spoken. If he had considered his position
at all, it would only have been to wish that Mrs. Barron
might be as proud as a Chestnut Street belle, in order to<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
afford him time to inform himself in relation to the
business of the men who occupied the other room.</p>

<p>"You have been shut up in Fort Lafayette once,"
added the first speaker.</p>

<p>"In a good cause I am willing to go again," replied
the voice so familiar to the ears of Somers. "I lost
eighty thousand dollars in a venture just like this. I
must get my money back."</p>

<p>"If you can, Coles."</p>

<p>Coles! But Somers did not need to have his identity
confirmed by the use of his name. He knew Coles's
voice. At Newport he had lain in the fore-sheets of the
academy boat, and heard Coles and Phil Kennedy mature
their plan to place the Snowden on the ocean, as a
Confederate cruiser. He had listened to the whole conversation
on that occasion, and the knowledge he had
thus obtained enabled the government to capture the
steamer, and defeat the intentions of the conspirators.</p>

<p>The last Somers had known of Coles, he was a prisoner
in Fort Lafayette. Probably he had been released
by the same influence which set Phil Kennedy at liberty,
and permitted him to continue his career of treason and
plunder. Coles had lost eighty thousand dollars by his
speculation in the Snowden, for one half of which Kennedy
was holden to him; but the bond had been effectually
cancelled by the death of the principal. Coles
wanted his money back. It was a very natural desire;<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
but Somers could not help considering it as a very extravagant
one, under present circumstances.</p>

<p>The listener could not help regarding it as a most
remarkable thing, that he should again be within hearing
of Coles, engaged in plotting treason. Such an
event might happen once; but that it should occur a
second time was absolutely marvellous. If our readers
are of the opinion that the writer is too severely taxing
their credulity in imposing the situation just described
upon them, he begs they will suspend their judgment till
the sequel justifies him.</p>

<p>It was so strange to Somers, that he could not help
thinking he had been brought there by some mysterious
power to listen to and defeat the intentions of the conspirators.
He was not so far wrong as he might have
been. It was Coles who spoke; it was Coles who had
been in Fort Lafayette; and it was Coles who had lost
eighty thousand dollars by the Snowden. All these things
were real, and Somers had no suspicion that he had inhaled
some of the vile compounds in the bar below,
which might have thrown him into a stupor wherein he
dreamed the astounding situation in which he was actually
placed.</p>

<p>Somers listened, and when Coles had mixed and drank
his dram, he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I can and will get my money back," said he, with
an oath which froze the blood of the listener.<span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>"Don't believe it, Coles."</p>

<p>"You know me, Langdon," added the plotter, with a
peculiar emphasis.</p>

<p>Langdon acknowledged that he did know him; and as
there was, therefore, no need of an introduction, Coles
proceeded.</p>

<p>"You know me, Langdon; I don't make any mistakes
myself."</p>

<p>Perhaps Langdon knew it; but Somers had some
doubts, which, however, he did not purpose to urge on
this occasion.</p>

<p>"Phil Kennedy was a fool," added Coles, with another
oath. "He spoiled all my plans before, and I was glad
when I heard that he was killed, though I lost forty
thousand dollars when he slipped out. He spilt the milk
for me."</p>

<p>Somers thought not.</p>

<p>"Phil was smart about some things; but he couldn't
keep a hotel. Why, that young pup that finally gave
him his quietus, twirled him around his fingers, like he
had been a school girl."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Coles; but I shall have the pleasure
of serving you in the same way before many weeks,"
thought Somers, flattered by this warm and disinterested
tribute to his strategetic ability.</p>

<p>"You mean Somers?" said Langdon.</p>

<p>"I mean Somers. The young pup isn't twenty-one<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
yet, but he is the smartest man in the old navy, by all
odds, whether the others be admirals, commodores, lieutenants,
or what not."</p>

<p>"That's high praise, Coles."</p>

<p>"It's true. If he wasn't an imfernal Yankee, I would
drink his health in this old Bourbon. Good liquor&mdash;isn't
it, Langdon?"</p>

<p>"Like the juice of a diamond."</p>

<p>"I would give more for this Somers than I would for
any four rear admirals. He has just been appointed to
the Chatauqua; but he will be in command of some small
craft down South, before many months, doing more mischief
to us than any four first-class steamers in the service.
He is as brave as a young lion; knows a ship
from keel to truck, and is as familiar with every bolt and
pin of an engine as though he had been a machinist all
his life."</p>

<p>"Big thing, eh, Coles?"</p>

<p>"If I had this Somers, I could make his fortune and
mine in a year, and have a million surplus besides."</p>

<p>"What would you do with him?"</p>

<p>"I would give him the command of my steamer. I
would rather have him in that place than all the old
grannies in the Confederate navy."</p>

<p>Somers thought Mr. Coles was rather extravagant.
He had no idea that Mr. Ensign Somers was one tenth
part of the man which the amiable and patronizing Mr.<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
Coles declared he was; and he was impatient to have
the speaker announce his intentions, rather than waste
any more time in such unwarrantable commendation.</p>

<p>But instead of telling what he intended to do, he confined
himself most provokingly to what he had failed to
do, giving Langdon minute details of the capture of the
Theban and the Snowden, dwelling with peculiar emphasis
on the agency of Somers in the work. This was not
interesting to the listener, but something better soon
followed.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE FRONT CHAMBER.</p>

<p>"But I am going to get back the money I lost, and
make a pile besides," said Coles, when he had
fully detailed the events attending the loss of the
Snowden.</p>

<p>"If you can," added the sceptical Langdon.</p>

<p>"Of course there is some risk, but my plans are so
well laid that a failure is hardly possible," continued
Coles.</p>

<p>"It was possible before."</p>

<p>"Nothing but an accident could have defeated my
plan before. Everything worked to my satisfaction,
and I was sure of success."</p>

<p>"But you failed."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail again."</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"Then believe I shall not," retorted Coles, apparently
irritated by the doubts and fears of his companion.</p>

<p>"It is not safe to believe too much," added Langdon,
with a kind of chuckle, whose force Somers could hardly
understand; "you believed too much before."<span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>"I have been more cautious this time, and I wouldn't
give anybody five per cent. to insure the venture."</p>

<p>Somers was becoming very impatient to hear the particulars
of the plan, for he was in momentary fear of
being summoned to the bedside of the wounded sailor.
Coles was most provokingly deliberate in the discussion
of his treasonable project; but when the naval officer
considered that the conversation was not especially
intended for him, he did not very severely censure the
conspirators for their tardiness.</p>

<p>"I don't understand what your plan is," said Langdon.</p>

<p>"Nor I either," was Somers's facetious thought.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it. Are there any ears
within hail of us?"</p>

<p>"Not an ear."</p>

<p>"Is there anybody in the front room?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"The old woman told me the front room was not
occupied. She sent in there an officer who wanted to
see a sick sailor upstairs; but he is gone before this
time."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; make sure on this point before I open
my mouth. I have no idea of being tripped up this
time," said the cautious Coles.</p>

<p>"I will look into the front room," added Langdon,
"though I know there is no one there."<span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>Somers was rather annoyed at this demonstration of
prudence; but it was quite natural, and he was all the
more interested to hear the rest of the conference. Dismissing
for a moment the dignity of the quarter deck,
he dropped hastily on the floor, and crawled under the
bed, concluding that Langdon, who was already fully
satisfied the front room was empty, would not push his
investigations to an unreasonable extent. But he had
already prepared himself for the worst, and if his presence
were detected, he resolved to take advantage of the
high estimation in which he was held, and, for his country's
good, proposed to offer his valuable services in
getting the piratical ship to sea. He could thus obtain
the secret, and defeat the purposes of the conspirators.</p>

<p>He fortunately avoided the necessity of resorting to
this disagreeable course, for Langdon only opened the
door, and glanced into the chamber he occupied.</p>

<p>"The room is empty," he reported to Coles, on his
return.</p>

<p>"There are cracks around this door big enough to
crawl through. Somebody may go into that room without
being heard, and listen to all I say."</p>

<p>"There is no danger."</p>

<p>"But there is danger; and I will not leave the ghost
of a chance to be discovered. Langdon, lock that front
room, and put the key in your pocket. I must have
things perfectly secure before I open my mouth."<span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>Langdon complied with the request of his principal;
the door was locked, and Somers, without much doubt
or distrust, found his retreat cut off for the present.
But, at last, everything was fixed to the entire satisfaction
of Coles. The glasses clinked again, indicating
that the worthies had fortified themselves with another
dose from the bottle. Somers crawled out from under
the bed, and heedless of the dust which whitened his
new uniform, placed himself in a comfortable position,
where he could hear all that was said by the confederates.</p>

<p>Coles now told his story in a straightforward, direct
manner, and Somers made memoranda on the back of a
letter of the principal facts in the statement. The arch
conspirator had just purchased a fine iron side-wheel
steamer, captured on the blockade, called the Ben Nevis.
She was about four hundred tons burden, and under
favorable circumstances had often made sixteen knots an
hour. It had already been announced in the newspapers
that the Ben Nevis would run regularly between New
York and St. John. Coles intended to clear her properly
for her destined port, where she could, by an arrangement
already made, be supplied with guns, ammunition,
and a crew. She was to clear regularly for New York,
but instead of proceeding there was to commence her
piratical course on the ocean.</p>

<p>This was the plan of the worthy Mr. Coles, which
Langdon permitted him to develop without a single<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
interruption. But the prudent, or rather critical, confederate
raised many objections, which were discussed
at great length&mdash;so great that Somers, possessed of the
principal facts, would have left the room, if the door had
not been locked, and escaped from the house, so as to
avoid the possibility of being discovered. The wounded
sailor could be attended to on the following day.</p>

<p>"But one thing we lack," continued Coles, after he
had removed all the objections of his companion.</p>

<p>"More than one, I fear," said the doubtful Langdon.</p>

<p>"Well, one thing more than all others."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A naval officer to command her."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of them."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it; but they are not the kind I want. I
need a man who will play into my hand, as well as grind
up the Yankees. I have no idea of burning all the
property captured by my vessel."</p>

<p>"Why don't you take command yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have other business to do."</p>

<p>"There are scores of Confederate naval officers in
Canada and New Brunswick," suggested Langdon.</p>

<p>"I know them all, and I wouldn't trust them to command
a mud-scow. In a word, Langdon, I want this
Somers, and I must have him."</p>

<p>"But he is a northern Yankee. He would sooner cut
his own throat than engage in such an enterprise."<span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you for that," said Somers to himself. "If
you had known me all my lifetime, you couldn't have
said a better or a truer thing of me."</p>

<p>"I know he is actually reeking with what he calls
loyalty. He will be a hard subject, but I think he can
be brought over."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he can."</p>

<p>"It must be done; that is the view we must take of
the matter."</p>

<p>"It will be easier to believe it than to do it."</p>

<p>"This is to be your share of the enterprise."</p>

<p>"Mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you have given me the biggest job in
the work."</p>

<p>"It can be done," said Coles, confidently. "Somers
is a mere boy in years, though he is smarter and knows
more than any man in the navy in the prime of life."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he is too smart, and knows too much to
be caught in such a scrape."</p>

<p>"No; he is young and ambitious. Offer him a commission
as a commander in the Confederate navy, to
begin with. I have the commission duly signed by the
president of the Confederacy, countersigned by the secretary
of the navy, with a blank for the name of the man
who receives it, which I am authorized to fill up as I
think best. Somers must have this commission."<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>"If he will take it."</p>

<p>"He will take it. In the old navy he is nothing but
a paltry ensign. He has been kept back. His merit
has been ignored. He must stand out of the way for
numskulls and old fogies. Even if the war should last
ten years longer, he could not reach the rank, in that
time, which I now tender him. He will at once be offered
the command of a fine steamer, and may walk the quarter
deck like a king. He is ambitious, and if you approach
him in the right way, you can win him over."</p>

<p>Somers listened with interest to this precious scheme.
He did not even feel complimented by the exalted opinion
which such a man as Coles entertained of him. It
would be a pleasant thing for a young man like him to
be a commander, and have a fine steamer; but as he
could regard only with horror the idea of firing a gun at
a vessel bearing the stars and stripes, he was not even
tempted by the bait; and he turned his thoughts from it
without the necessity of a "Get thee behind me, Satan,"
in dismissing it.</p>

<p>"Where is this Somers?" asked Langdon.</p>

<p>"He is at the Continental," replied Coles. "He has
been appointed fourth lieutenant of the Chatauqua; but
what a position for a man of his abilities! He is better
qualified to command the ship than the numskull to
whom she has been given. Waldron, the first lieutenant,
is smart: he ought to be commander; though I think<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
Somers did all the hard work in Doboy Sound, for which
Waldron got the credit, and for which he was promoted.
Pillgrim, the second lieutenant, is a renegade Virginian."</p>

<p>"We had some hopes of him, at one time," said
Langdon.</p>

<p>"He is worse than a Vermont Yankee now&mdash;has been
all along, for that matter. I tried to do something with
him, but he talked about the old flag, and other bosh of
that sort."</p>

<p>"Let him go," added Langdon, with becoming resignation.</p>

<p>"Let him go! He never went. He has always been
a Yankee at heart. If the navy department wouldn't
trust him, it was their fault, not his, for the South has
not had a worse enemy than he since the first gun was
fired at Sumter. He is none the better, and all the
more dangerous to us, because he gives the South credit
for skill and bravery."</p>

<p>Somers was pleased to hear this good account of Lieutenant
Pillgrim; not because he had any doubt in regard
to his loyalty, but because it confirmed the good impression
he had received of his travelling companion. If
the conspirators would only have graciously condescended
to resolve the doubts in his mind in regard to some
indefinite previous acquaintance he had had with the
second lieutenant of the Chatauqua, he would have been
greatly obliged to them. They did not do this, and Somers<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
was still annoyed and puzzled by the belief, patent to
his consciousness, that he had somewhere been intimate
with the "renegade Virginian," before they met at the
house of Commodore Portington.</p>

<p>"Now, Langdon, you must contrive to meet Somers,
sound him, and bring him over. You must be cautious
with him. He is a young man of good morals&mdash;never
drinks, gambles, or goes to bad places. He is a perfect
gentleman in his manners, never swears, and is the pet
of the chaplains."</p>

<p>"I think I can manage him."</p>

<p>"I know you can; I have picked you out of a hundred
smart fellows for this work."</p>

<p>"How will it do for me to put on a white choker, and
approach him as a doctor of divinity."</p>

<p>"You can't humbug him."</p>

<p>"If I can't, why should I try?"</p>

<p>"If you should pretend to be a clergyman, and he
smelt the whiskey in your breath, he would set you down
as a hypocrite at once."</p>

<p>"That's so," thought Somers.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't listen to a preacher who drank whiskey.
He is a fanatic on these points."</p>

<p>Somers could not imagine where Coles had obtained
such an intimate knowledge of his views and principles;
though, if he wanted his services in the Confederate
navy, it was probable he had made diligent inquiries in
regard to his opinions and habits.<span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>"I think I could blind him as a D.D., but I am not
strenuous."</p>

<p>"You had better get acquainted with him in some
other capacity."</p>

<p>"As you please; I will think over the matter, and be
ready to make a strike to-morrow morning. What time
is it?"</p>

<p>"Quarter past ten."</p>

<p>"So late! I must be off at once."</p>

<p>Somers heard the clatter of glass-ware again, as the
conspirators took the parting libation. He listened to
their retreating footsteps, heard Langdon return the key,
and then began to wonder what had become of Tom
Barron and his mother. He had waited more than two
hours in the front room, and no summons had come for
him to see the wounded sailor. It was very singular, to
say the least; but while he was deliberating on the point,
a hand was placed on the door of the chamber. The
key turned, and a person entered.</p>

<p>Now, Somers had a very strong objection to being
seen after what had occurred. If discovered in this
room, Coles might see him, and finding his plans discovered,
might change them so as to defeat the ends of
justice. And the listener felt that, if detected in this
apartment by the conspirators, they would not scruple to
take his life in order to save themselves and their
schemes.<span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>For these reasons Somers decided not to be seen.
The person who entered the room was a rough, seafaring
man, and evidently intended to sleep there, which
Somers was entirely willing he should do, if it could be
done without imperilling his personal safety. He therefore
crawled under the bed again, as quietly as possible.
Unfortunately it was not quietly enough to escape the
observation of the lodger, who, not being of the timid sort,
seized him by the leg, dragged him out, and with a
volley of marine oaths, began to kick him with his heavy
boot.</p>

<p>Somers sprang to his feet, and attempted to explain;
but the indignant seaman struck him a heavy blow on
the head, which felled him senseless on the floor.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="h3">SOMERS COMES TO HIS SENSES.</p>

<p>When Somers opened his eyes, about half an
hour after the striking event just narrated,
and became conscious that he was still in
the land of the living, he was lying on the bed in his
chamber at the Continental. By his side stood Lieutenant
Pillgrim and a surgeon.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" asked the young officer, using the
original expression made and provided for occasions of
this kind.</p>

<p>"You are here, my dear fellow," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>This valuable information seemed to afford the injured
party a great deal of consolation, for he looked around
the apartment, not wildly, as he would have done if this
book were a novel, but with a look of perplexity and
dissatisfaction. As Mr. Ensign Somers was eminently
a fighting man on all proper occasions, he probably felt
displeased with himself to think he had given the stalwart
seaman so easy a victory; for he distinctly remembered
the affair in which he had been so rudely treated,<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
though there was a great gulf between the past and the
present in his recollection.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Mr. Somers?" asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>"The fact that I feel at all is quite enough for me at
the present time, without going into the question as to
how I feel," replied the patient, with a sickly smile. "I
don't exactly know how I do feel. My ideas are rather
confused."</p>

<p>"I should think they might be," added the surgeon.
"You have had a hard rap on the head."</p>

<p>"So I should judge, for my brain is rather muddled."</p>

<p>"Does your head pain you?" asked the medical gentleman,
placing his hand on the injured part.</p>

<p>"It does not exactly pain me, but it feels rather sore.
I think I will get up, and see how that affects me."</p>

<p>Somers got up, and immediately came to the conclusion
that he was not very badly damaged; and the surgeon
was happy to corroborate his opinion. With the
exception of a soreness over the left temple, he felt pretty
well. The blow from the iron fist of the burly seaman
had stunned him; and the kicks received from the big
boots of the assailant had produced sundry black and
blue places on his body, which a man not accustomed to
hard knocks might have looked upon with suspicion, but
to which Somers paid no attention.</p>

<p>The surgeon had carefully examined him before his
consciousness returned, and was fully satisfied that he<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
had not been seriously injured. Somers walked across
the room two or three times, and bathed his head with
cold water, which in a great measure restored the consistency
of his ideas. He felt a little sore, but he soon
became as chipper and as cheerful as an early robin.
His first thought was, that he had escaped being murdered,
and he was devoutly thankful to God for the
mercy which had again spared his life.</p>

<p>The doctor, after giving him some directions in regard
to his head, and the black and blue spots on his body,
left the room. He was a naval surgeon, a guest in the
hotel, and promised to see his patient again in the
morning.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Somers?" asked Lieutenant Pillgrim,
who sat on the bed, gazing with interest, not unmixed
with anxiety, at his companion.</p>

<p>"I feel pretty well, considering the hard rap I got on
the head."</p>

<p>"You have a hard head, Somers."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"If you had not, you would have been a dead man.
The fellow pounded you with his fist, which is about as
heavy as an anvil, and kicked you with his boots, which
are large enough and stout enough to make two very
respectable gunboats."</p>

<p>"Things are rather mixed in my mind," added Somers,
rubbing his head again, as if to explain how a<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
strong-minded young man like himself should be troubled
in his upper works.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at that. You have remained insensible
more than half an hour. I was afraid, before
the surgeon saw you, that your pipe was out, and you had
become a D.D. without taking orders."</p>

<p>"I think I had a narrow escape. What a tiger the
fellow was that pitched into me!"</p>

<p>"It was all a mistake on his part."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was; but that don't make my head feel
any better. Who is he, and what is he?"</p>

<p>"He is the captain of a coaster. He had considerable
money in his pocket, and he thought you had concealed
yourself in his room for the purpose of robbing
him. When he saw that you were an officer in the
navy, he was overwhelmed with confusion, and really
felt very bad about it."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I blame him for what he did,
under the circumstances. His conclusion was not a very
unnatural one. I don't exactly comprehend how I happen
to be in the Continental House, after these stunning
events."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Pillgrim, with a smile.</p>

<p>"If I had been in condition to expect anything, I
should naturally have expected to find myself, on coming
to my senses, in the low groggery where I received the
blows."<span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>"That is very easily accounted for. I happened to be
at the house when you were struck down. I was in the
lower room, and heard the row. With others I went up
to see what the matter was. I had a carriage in the
street, and when I recognized you, the captain of the
coaster, at my request, took you up in his arms like a
baby, carried you down into the street, and put you into
the vehicle, and you were brought here. I presume this
will fill up the entire gap in your recollection."</p>

<p>"It is all as clear as mud now," laughed Somers.
"Mr. Pillgrim, I am very grateful to you for the kind
offices you rendered me."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, my dear fellow. I should have
been worse than a brute if I had done any less than I
did."</p>

<p>"That may be; but my gratitude is none the less earnest
on that account. Those are villainous people in that
house, and I might have been butchered and cut up, if I
had been left there."</p>

<p>"I think not. The captain of the coaster is evidently
an honest man; at any rate he is very sorry for what he
did. But, Somers, my dear fellow,&mdash;you will pardon
me if I seem impertinent,&mdash;how did you happen to be in
such a place?" continued Mr. Pillgrim, with a certain
affectation of slyness in his look, as though he had
caught the exemplary young man in a house where he
would not have been willing to be seen.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>"How did <i>you</i> happen to be there?" demanded
Somers.</p>

<p>"I don't profess to be a very proper person. I take
my whiskey when I want it."</p>

<p>"So do I; and the only difference between us is, that
I never happen to want it."</p>

<p>"I did not go into that house for my whiskey, though.
It is rather strange that we should both happen into such
a place at the same time."</p>

<p>"Rather strange."</p>

<p>"But I will tell you why I was there," added Pillgrim.
"I received a letter from a wounded sailor, asking
me to call upon him, and assist him in obtaining a
pension."</p>

<p>"Did you, indeed!" exclaimed Somers, amazed at this
explanation. "You have also told how I happened to
be there."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"I received just such a letter as that you describe,"
replied Somers, taking the dirty epistle from his pocket,
which he opened and exhibited to his brother officer.</p>

<p>"The handwriting is the same, and the substance of
both letters is essentially the same. That's odd&mdash;isn't
it?" continued the lieutenant, as he drew the epistle he
had received from his pocket. "I got mine when I
came in, about ten o'clock; and thinking I might go to
New York in the morning for a couple of days, I thought
I would attend to the matter at once."<span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>Somers took the letters, and compared them. They
were written by the same person, on the same kind of
paper, and were both mailed on the same day.</p>

<p>"This looks rather suspicious to me," added Pillgrim,
reflecting on the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Why suspicious?"</p>

<p>"Why should both of us have been called? Tom
Barron claims to have served with me, as he did with
you. I don't remember any such person."</p>

<p>"Neither do I."</p>

<p>"Did you find out whether there was any such person
at the house as Tom Barron?"</p>

<p>"The woman at the bar told me there was a wounded
sailor there whose description answered to that contained
in the letter."</p>

<p>"So she told me. Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I did not; and between you and me, I don't believe
there is any Tom Barron there, or anywhere else. This
business must be investigated," said Pillgrim, very decidedly.</p>

<p>Somers did not wish it to be investigated. He was
utterly opposed to an investigation, for he was fearful, if
the matter should be "ventilated," that more would be
shown than he was willing to have exhibited at the present
time; in other words, Coles would find out that his enterprising
scheme had been exposed to a third person.<span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>"I don't care to be mixed up in any revelations of
low life, Mr. Pillgrim; and, as I have lost nothing, and
the hard knocks I received were given under a mistake,
I think I would rather let the matter rest just where
it is."</p>

<p>"Very natural for a young man of your style,"
laughed the lieutenant. "You are afraid the people of
Pinchbrook will read in the papers that Mr. Somers has
been in bad places."</p>

<p>"They might put a wrong construction on the case,"
replied Somers, willing to have his reasons for avoiding
an investigation as strong as possible.</p>

<p>"I can hand these letters over to the police, and let
the officers inquire into the matter," added Pillgrim.
"They need not call any names."</p>

<p>"I would rather not stir up the dirty pool. Besides,
Tom Barron and his mother may be in the house, after
all. There is no evidence to the contrary."</p>

<p>"I shall satisfy myself on that point by another visit
to the house. If I find there is such a person there, I
shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>"That will be the better way."</p>

<p>Just then it occurred to Somers that Coles might have
seen him while he was insensible, and was already aware
that his scheme had miscarried. He questioned Pillgrim,
therefore, in regard to the persons in the bar-room
when he entered. From the answers received he satisfied<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
himself that the conspirators had departed before
the "row" in the front room occurred.</p>

<p>"Now, Somers, I am going down to that house again
before I sleep," said the lieutenant. "This time, I shall
take my revolver. Will you go with me?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel exactly able to go out again to-night.
My head doesn't feel just right," replied Somers, who,
however, had other reasons for keeping his room, the
principal of which was the fear that he might meet Coles
there, and that, by some accident, his presence in the
front room during the conference might be disclosed.</p>

<p>"I think you are right, Somers. You had better
keep still to-night," said Pillgrim. "Shall I send you
up anything?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I don't need anything."</p>

<p>"A glass of Bourbon whiskey would do you good.
It would quiet your nerves, and put you to sleep."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would, but I shall lie awake on those
terms."</p>

<p>"Don't be bigoted, my dear fellow. Of course I prescribe
the whiskey as a medicine."</p>

<p>"You are no surgeon."</p>

<p>"It would quiet your nerves."</p>

<p>"Let them kick, if nothing but whiskey will quiet
them," laughed Somers. "Seriously, Mr. Pillgrim, I
am very much obliged to you for your kindness, and for
your interest in me; but I think I shall be better without
the whiskey than with it."<span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>"As you please, Somers. If you are up when I return,
I will tell you what I find at the house."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will leave my door unfastened."</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim left the room to make his perilous examination
of the locality of his friend's misfortunes. Somers
walked the apartment, nervous and excited, considering
the events of the evening. He then seated himself,
and carefully wrote out the statement of Coles in regard
to the Ben Nevis, and the method by which he purposed
to operate in getting her to sea as a Confederate cruiser,
with extended memoranda of all the conversation to
which he had listened. Before he had finished this task,
Lieutenant Pillgrim returned.</p>

<p>"It is all right," said he, as he entered the room.</p>

<p>"What's all right?"</p>

<p>"There is such a person as Thomas Barron. The
facts contained in the letters are essentially true."</p>

<p>"Then no investigation is necessary," replied Somers,
with a feeling of relief.</p>

<p>"None whatever; to-morrow I will see that the poor
fellow is sent to the hospital, and his mother provided for."</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim, after again recommending a glass of
whiskey, took his leave, and Somers finished his paper.
He went to bed, and in spite of the fact that he had
drank no whiskey, his nerves were quiet, and he dropped
asleep like a good Christian, with a prayer in his heart
for the "loved ones at home" and elsewhere.<span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>The next morning, though he was still quite sore, and
his head felt heavier than usual, he was in much better
condition, physically, than could have been expected.
After breakfast, as he sat in the parlor of the hotel, he
was accosted by a gentleman in blue clothes, with a very
small cap on his head.</p>

<p>"An officer of the navy, I perceive," said the stranger,
courteously.</p>

<p>"How are you, Langdon?" was the thought, but not
the reply, of Somers.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="h3">LIEUTENANT WYNKOOP, R. N.</p>

<p>The gentlemanly individual who addressed Somers
wore the uniform of an English naval officer.
By easy and gentle approaches, he proceeded to
make himself very agreeable. He was lavish in his
praise of the achievements of the "American navy," and
was sure that no nation on the face of the globe had ever
displayed such skill and energy in creating a war marine.
Somers listened patiently to this eloquent and just tribute
to the enterprise of his country; and if he had not suspected
that the enthusiastic speaker was playing an assumed
character, he would have ventured to suggest that
the position of John Bull was rather equivocal; that a
little less admiration, and a little more genuine sympathy,
would be more acceptable.</p>

<p>"We sailors belong to the same fraternity all over the
world," said the pretended Englishman. "There is
something in sailors which draws them together. I
never meet one without desiring to know him better.
Allow me to present you my card, and beg the favor of
yours in return."<span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>He handed his card to Somers, who read upon it the
name of "Lieutenant Wynkoop, R. N." It was elaborately
engraved, and our officer began to have some doubts
in regard to his new-found acquaintance, for the card
could hardly have been got up since the interview of the
preceding evening. This gentleman might not be Langdon,
after all; but whether he was or not, it was proper
to treat him with respect and consideration. Somers
wrote his name on a blank card, and gave it to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Somers: here is my hand," said
Lieutenant Wynkoop, when he had read the name. "I
am happy to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>Somers took the offered hand, and made a courteous
reply, to the salutations of the other.</p>

<p>"May I beg the favor of your company to dinner with
me in my private parlor to-day?" continued Mr. Wynkoop.
"I have a couple of bottles of fine old sherry,
which have twice made the voyage to India, sent to me
by an esteemed American friend residing in this city."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Wynkoop. To the dinner I have
not the slightest objection; to the wine I have; and I'm
afraid you must reserve it for some one who will appreciate
it more highly than I can. I never drink wine."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed?" said the presumed representative of
the royal navy, as he adjusted an eye-glass to his left eye,
keeping it in position by contracting the muscles above
and below the visual member, which gave a peculiar<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
squint to his expression, very trying to the risibles of
his auditor.</p>

<p>"I should be happy to dine with you, but I don't drink
wine," repeated Somers, in good-natured but rather bluff
tones, for he did not wish to be understood as apologizing
for his total abstinence principles.</p>

<p>"I should be glad to meet you in my private parlor,
say, at four o'clock, whether you drink wine or not, Mr.
Somers."</p>

<p>"Four o'clock?"</p>

<p>"It's rar-ther early, I know. If you prefer five, say
the word," drawled Mr. Wynkoop.</p>

<p>"I should say that would be nearer supper time than
four," replied Somers, who had lately been in the habit
of dining at twelve in Pinchbrook.</p>

<p>"Earlier if you please, then."</p>

<p>"Any hour that is convenient for you will suit me."</p>

<p>"Let it be four, then. But I must acknowledge, Mr.
Somers, I am not entirely unselfish in desiring to make
your acquaintance. The operations of the American
navy have astonished me, and I wish to know more about
it. I landed in New York only a few days since, and I
improve every opportunity to make the acquaintance of
American naval officers. I have not yet visited one of
your dock yards."</p>

<p>"I am going over to look at my ship this forenoon,
and I should be delighted with your company."<span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you! thank you!" exclaimed Mr. Wynkoop.
"I shall be under great obligations to you for the favor."</p>

<p>They went to the navy yard, visited the Chatauqua,
and other vessels of war fitting out there. Mr. Wynkoop
asked a thousand questions about ships, engines,
and armaments; and one could hardly help regarding
him as the most enthusiastic admirer of naval architecture.
Though the gentleman spoke in affected tones,
Somers had recognized the voice of Langdon. This was
the person, without a doubt, who was to lure him into
the Confederate navy, who was to crown his aspirations
with a commander's commission, and reward his infidelity
with the command of a fine steamer.</p>

<p>Somers was very impatient for the inquiring member
of the royal navy to make his proposition; for, strange as
it may seem to the loyal reader, he had fully resolved to
accept the brilliant offers he expected to receive; to permit
Coles to place the name of "John Somers" in the
blank of the commander's commission which he had in
his possession; and even to take his place on the quarter
deck of the Ben Nevis, if it became necessary to carry
proceedings to that extent.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant Wynkoop did not even allude to the
Confederate navy, or to the Ben Nevis, and did not even
attempt to sound the loyalty of his companion. Somers
concluded at last that this matter was reserved for the
after-dinner conversation; and as he could afford to<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
wait, he continued to give his friend every facility for
prosecuting his inquiries into the secret of the marvellous
success of the "American navy."</p>

<p>After writing out his statement of Coles's plans, he had
carefully and prayerfully considered his duty in relation
to the startling information he had thus accidentally obtained.
Of course he had no doubt as to what he should
do. He must be sure that the Ben Nevis was handed
over to the government; that Coles and Langdon were put
in close quarters. He only inquired how this should be
done. Though the Snowden and the Theban had been
captured in the former instance, both Kennedy and Coles
had escaped punishment, and one of them was again engaged
in the work of pulling down the government.</p>

<p>If he gave information at the present stage of the conspiracy,
his plans might be defeated. Though Coles had
mentioned no names, it was more than probable that he
was aided and abetted in his treasonable projects by other
persons. There were traitors in Boston, New York, and
Philadelphia, men of wealth and influence, occupying
high positions in society, who were engaged in just such
enterprises as that which had been revealed to the young
naval officer.</p>

<p>Somers felt, therefore, that a premature exposure
might ruin himself without overthrowing the conspirators.
A word from one of these influential men might
lay him on the shelf, to say the least, and remove all<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
suspicion from the guilty ones. He must proceed with the
utmost caution, both for his own safety and the success
of his enterprise.</p>

<p>Besides, he felt that, if he could get "inside of the
ring," he should find out who the great men were that
were striking at the heart of the nation in the dark. By
obtaining the confidence of the conspirators, he could the
more easily baffle them, and do the country a greater
service than he could render on the quarter deck of the
Chatauqua.</p>

<p>After an earnest and careful consideration of the whole
matter, he concluded that his present duty was to pay
out rope enough to permit Coles and his guilty associates
to hang themselves. For this purpose, he was prepared
to receive Langdon with open arms, to accept the commission
intended for him, and to enter into the secret
councils of his country's bitterest enemies.</p>

<p>Somers, pure and patriotic in his motives, did not for
a moment consider that he exposed himself to any risk
in thus entering the councils of the wicked, or even in
taking a commission in the service of the enemy. He
did not intend to aid or abet in the treason of the traitors,
and he did not think what might be the result if a rebel
commission were found upon his person. He might be
killed in battle with this damning document in his pocket.
If any of the conspirators were caught, they might denounce
him as one of their number. He did not think<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
of these things. He was ambitious to serve his treason-ridden
country, and he forgot all about himself.</p>

<p>It was half past three when Somers and Wynkoop
returned to the hotel from their visit to the navy yard.
Langdon had evidently been in England, for he insisted
upon calling it a "dock yard." They separated to dress
for dinner, as the courtly John Bull expressed it. At
four they met again in the private parlor, where an
elegant dinner was served, and where Mr. Wynkoop
sipped his sherry "which had twice made the voyage to
the East Indies," though it probably came from the
cellar of the hotel. When the coffee had been brought
in, and the waiters had retired, the representative of the
royal navy lighted his cigar, and began, in a very moderate
way, to express some slight admiration for the skill
and prowess of the rebels. Somers helped him along
until he became a thorough rebel.</p>

<p>"With all my admiration for the American navy, Mr.
Somers, I find there is a great deal of injustice towards
the officers, especially the younger ones," continued Mr.
Wynkoop, after he had sufficiently indicated his sympathy
for the "noble and gallant people who were struggling
against such hodds in the South."&mdash;The lieutenant occasionally
pressed an <i>h</i> into use where it was not needed&mdash;probably
to be entirely consistent with himself.</p>

<p>"That's true; and I have suffered from it myself,"
replied Somers, determined that his companion should<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
want no inducement to make his proposition as soon as
he was ready.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, Mr. Somers;" and Mr. Wynkoop
stated some instances which had come to his knowledge.</p>

<p>Somers then gave a list of his own imaginary grievances,
and professed to be greatly dissatisfied with his
present position and prospects.</p>

<p>"I think you would do better in the Confederate
navy," said the lieutenant, warmly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should."</p>

<p>"Whichever side you fight for, you fight for your own
country."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"When the South wins,&mdash;as win she will,&mdash;all who
fought against her, will be like prophets in their own
country&mdash;without honor. In less than two months the
independence of the Confederate States will be acknowledged
by England and France. I happen to know this."</p>

<p>"It would not surprise me."</p>

<p>"My uncle, the Earl of&mdash;never mind; I won't mention
his name&mdash;my uncle, who is an intimate friend of
Palmerston, told me so."</p>

<p>Somers was rather glad to hear it, for it would bring
the desolating war to a close. Mr. Wynkoop hesitated
no longer. He approached the real business of the meeting
rapidly, and in a few moments the commander's
commission was on the table. The offer was made, and<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Somers, with such apparent qualms of conscience as a
naval officer might be expected to exhibit on deserting
his flag, accepted the proposition. Mr. Wynkoop went
into his sleeping apartment, adjoining the parlor, with
the commission in his hand.</p>

<p>He returned in a moment with the name of "John
Somers," filled in the blank space left for that purpose,
and handed it to his guest.</p>

<p>Somers shuddered when he saw his name written upon
such an infernal document; for though he was still true
to God, his country, and himself, the paper had an ugly
look. But he regarded it only as evidence against the
conspirators, rather than against himself; as a necessary
formality to enable him to frustrate the designs of traitors,
rather than as a blot against his own name.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I congratulate you. If you could be
induced to join me in a glass of this old sherry, we
would drink to the success of the Louisiana&mdash;for that
is to be the name of your craft when you get to sea."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mr. Wynkoop; you must excuse me."</p>

<p>"As you please. Mr. Somers, though I am an Englishman,
and belong to the royal navy, it is hardly necessary
for me to say now, that I am in the service of the
South. I go with you in the Louisiana, as a passenger.
Your first work will be to capture one of the California
steamers, which I am to transform into a man-of-war,
and call the Texas. She will be under my command."<span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>"I am satisfied."</p>

<p>"By the way, Captain Somers," added Wynkoop, as
he took a paper from his pocket, "here is the oath of
allegiance to the Confederate States of America, which
it will be necessary for you to sign."</p>

<p>This was more than Somers had bargained for, and he
would have cut off his right hand, or permitted his head
to be severed from his body, rather than put his signature
to the detested paper. A cold chill crept through
his veins, as he glanced at the sheet on which it was
printed, and he was afraid all he had done would fail
because he could not do this thing.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wynkoop brought a pen and ink from his
sleeping apartment, and placed it by the side of his guest.</p>

<p>"I would rather not sign this just now," said Somers.
"It might get me into trouble."</p>

<p>"Very well; we will attend to that after you get on
board of the Ben Nevis," replied Wynkoop, as he took
the oath and the commission, with the pen and ink, and
went into his chamber again.</p>

<p>He was absent several minutes this time, and Somers
had an opportunity to review his position.</p>

<p>"Here is your commission, Captain Somers," said the
lieutenant, as he placed the document on the table. "On
the whole, I think you had better sign the oath now."</p>

<p>"I think it will do just as well when we get off."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will; here are your orders," said he,<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
handing Somers another paper, and placing that containing
the oath on the table.</p>

<p>At this moment, Somers heard a step in the direction
of the bedroom. He turned, with surprise, to see who it
was, for he had heard no one enter.</p>

<p>"Ah, Somers, I am glad to see you," said the new
arrival, stepping up to the table, and glancing at the
papers which lay open there.</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Pillgrim.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h3">LANGDON'S LETTERS.</p>

<p>It had been no part of Somers's purpose to bear
the whole responsibility of the transactions in
which he had so promptly engaged. Mr. Waldron
would return in a few days, and on his arrival,
the overburdened young officer intended to confide
the momentous secret to him, receiving the benefit of
his advice and support in the great business he had
undertaken.</p>

<p>After the kind treatment he had received at the hands
of Lieutenant Pillgrim, he was rather disposed to make
him a confidant; but he knew so little about his travelling
companion, that though he had no question about
his fidelity and honor, he was not quite willing to stake
everything on his judgment and discretion, as he must
do, if he opened the subject to him.</p>

<p>Somers was not a little surprised to see Mr. Pillgrim
enter the parlor in that unceremonious way. It indicated
a degree of intimacy between the two gentleman that
gave him an unpleasant impression, which, however, he
had no time to follow out to its legitimate issue.<span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Wynkoop," said Lieutenant Pillgrim,
as he paused at the side of the table, "for entering
in this abrupt manner. I have been knocking at your
door for some time, without obtaining a response."</p>

<p>"You went to the wrong door. That's my bedroom."</p>

<p>"So I perceive, now."</p>

<p>"But there is no harm done; on the contrary, I am
very glad to see you. Sit down and take a glass of wine
with me. Mr. Somers does not indulge."</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers is a very proper young man," said the
lieutenant, with a pleasant smile, as he glanced again at
the papers which lay open on the table. "I have been
looking for you, Somers, but it was only to ask you what
the prospect is on board the Chatauqua. I have not
been on board to-day."</p>

<p>"I think we shall be wanted by to-morrow or next
day," replied Somers, who could not help seeing that the
eye of his superior officer was fixed on the commander's
commission, which lay open before him.</p>

<p>"Indeed! I am glad to know this, for I had made
up my mind to go to New York in the morning. Of
course I shall not go."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr.&mdash;Really, sir, you must excuse me,
but I have forgotten your name," said Mr. Wynkoop.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Pillgrim&mdash;at your service. It is not
very surprising that you should forget it, since we have<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
met but once; not half so surprising as that I should
force myself into your rooms, on so short an acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, my dear fellow. We sailors are
brothers all over the world. Sit down, and take a glass
of sherry with me. It's a capital wine&mdash;made two
voyages to India."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Wynkoop; I merely called to invite
you to spend the evening with me. I have a plan that
will use up two or three hours very pleasantly."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Pillgrim. You are a friend in need,
and a friend indeed."</p>

<p>"I see that you and Mr. Somers have business, and
I will take my leave."</p>

<p>"I should be happy to have you remain, but if you
will not, I will join you in half an hour in the reading-room.
Better sit down, and wait here."</p>

<p>"I will not interrupt your business with Mr. Somers,"
replied Lieutenant Pillgrim, again glancing curiously at
the documents on the table.</p>

<p>Greatly to the relief of Somers, his fellow-officer left
the room. This visit had been a most unfortunate one,
for the lieutenant could not have avoided seeing the nature
of the papers on the table. But as Somers was a true
and loyal man, his conscience accused him of no wrong,
and he had no fears in regard to the result. This revelation
simply imposed upon him the necessity of making<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
Mr. Pillgrim his confidant, which he proposed to do at
the first convenient opportunity.</p>

<p>"You think you will not sign the oath to-night, Mr.
Somers?" said his companion.</p>

<p>"It had better be deferred," replied Somers, as he
folded up the commission, and put it in his pocket, regarding
it as the most important evidence in his possession
against Coles, and a sufficient confirmation of the truth of
the statement he had so carefully written out the night
before.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself, Somers. We shall not differ about
these small matters," added Wynkoop, as he folded up
the oath, and put it in his pocket. "By the way,
Somers, what do you think of our friend Pillgrim?"</p>

<p>"He is a fine fellow, and I am told he is a good
officer. I was not aware that you knew him."</p>

<p>"I have only met him once, just as I met you. How
do you think he stands affected towards our cause?"</p>

<p>"Not well."</p>

<p>"So I feared."</p>

<p>"He is a loyal man, though a Virginian."</p>

<p>"Do you think I could make anything of him?"</p>

<p>"I am satisfied you could not."</p>

<p>"I did not dare to try him. I gave him a chance to
nibble at my bait, but he wouldn't bite. Perhaps, when
I know him better, he will come round; for I don't think
there are many of these Yankee officers that have any
real heart in their work."<span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>"You are utterly mistaken," said Somers; but remembering
that he was hardly in a position to defend his
loyal comrades in the navy, he did not seriously combat
the proposition of the rebel emissary.</p>

<p>As the business of the interview was now finished,
Somers shook hands with his agreeable host&mdash;though his
heart repelled the act,&mdash;and took leave of him. He
hastened to his chamber, agitated and excited by the
strange and revolting scene through which he had just
passed. It was some time before he was calm enough to
think coherently of what he had done, and of the compact
he had made. He wished very much to see Mr.
Waldron now; indeed, he felt the absolute necessity of
confiding to some trustworthy person the momentous
secret he had obtained, which burned in his soul like an
evil deed.</p>

<p>If Lieutenant Pillgrim had not actually read his commission
when it lay on the table, he must, at least, have
suspected that all was not right with his shipmate. He
must, therefore, confide in him, and without the loss of
another moment, he hastened to his room for this purpose;
but the lieutenant was not there. He searched
for him in all the public rooms of the hotel, but without
success. Remembering that his fellow-officer was to
meet Mr. Wynkoop in the reading-room half an hour
from the time they parted, he waited there over an hour,
but the appointment evidently was not kept by either
party.<span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>Somers did not wish to sleep another night without
sharing his great secret with some one; for if anything
should happen to him, he reasoned, the commission and
the orders might be found in his possession, and subject
him to very unpleasant suspicions, if they did not expose
him to the actual charge of complicity with the enemies
of his country. He waited in the vicinity of the office
till midnight, hoping to see Mr. Pillgrim; but he did not
appear, and he reluctantly retired to his chamber.</p>

<p>When he carried his key to the office in the morning,
there was a note in his box, addressed to him. The ink
of the direction was hardly dry, and the lap of the envelope
was still wet where it had been moistened to seal it.
Somers opened it. He was surprised and startled at its
contents; but the writer had evidently made a mistake in
the superscription. It was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Pillgrim</span>: I have just sent a note to
Somers, saying that the Ben Nevis has sailed,&mdash;which
is a fact,&mdash;and that he must join her at Mobile, where
she will run in a cargo of arms and provisions. Act
accordingly. How is this?</p>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">Langdon.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the name and the import of the letter implied
that the note was not intended for Somers, though it
was directed to him. The writer had evidently written<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
two notes, and in his haste had misdirected the envelopes.</p>

<p>"My dear Pillgrim!" The note was intended for his
fellow-officer. Was Pillgrim a confederate of Langdon?
It looked so, incredible as it seemed.</p>

<p>Somers was bewildered for a moment, but he was too
good a strategist to be overwhelmed. Restoring the note
to its envelope, he readjusted the lap, which was still
wet, and the letter looked as though it had not been
opened. He returned it to the box under his key, and
perceived that there was also a note in Mr. Pillgrim's
box. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the letters
would be changed. He returned to his room to await
the result.</p>

<p>Somers had made an astounding discovery by the
merest accident in the world. Things were not what
they seemed. Mr. Pillgrim had relations of some kind
with Langdon, <i>alias</i> Lieutenant Wynkoop. His entering
the parlor while they were at dinner was not so accidental
a circumstance as it had appeared. Who and what
was Lieutenant Pillgrim? The belief that he had met
him somewhere before they came together at Newport,
still haunted Somers; but he was in no better condition
now than then to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>In half an hour he went down to the office again.
The note to Mr. Pillgrim was gone; but there was one
for himself in the box. He took it out; the direction<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
was not in the same handwriting as before. Mr. Pillgrim
had probably discovered the mistake, and changed
the letters, without a suspicion that the one addressed to
himself had been read. Somers opened the note, which
contained the information he expected to find there in
regard to the Ben Nevis, and was signed by Wynkoop.</p>

<p>Beyond the possibility of a doubt now, Lieutenant Pillgrim
was a confederate of Langdon. Of course, he
knew Coles. He was a Virginian, and it was now certain
to Somers, if to no one else, that his loyalty had
been justly suspected. He had doubtless entered the
navy again for a purpose. What that purpose was,
remained yet to be exposed. From the depths of his
heart, Somers thanked God that this discovery had been
made; and he determined to put it to good use. He
was now more anxious than before to meet his friend
Mr. Waldron, and communicate the startling information
to him.</p>

<p>From the morning papers he saw that the Ben Nevis,
whose name had been changed to that of a famous Union
general, had actually sailed, as Langdon's note informed
him. In the forenoon, he went to the navy yard, expecting
to find the ship ready to go into commission; but
he learned that the bed-plates of her pivot guns had to be
recast, and that she would not be ready for another week.
He also learned that his friend Mr. Waldron had been
taken down with typhoid fever at his home, and was
then in a critical condition.<span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>Somers was not only shocked, but disconcerted by this
intelligence, for it deprived him of the friend and counsellor
whom he needed in this emergency. After careful
deliberation, he obtained a furlough of a week, and
went to the home of Mr. Waldron; but the sufferer
could not even be seen, much less consulted on a matter
of business. Left to act for himself, he hastened to New
York, and then to Boston, to ascertain what he could in
regard to the Ben Nevis. So far as he could learn,
everything was all right in regard to her. After a short
visit to Pinchbrook, he hastened back to Philadelphia,
and found the Chatauqua hauled out into the stream, and
ready to go into commission at once. Lieutenant Pillgrim
and the other officers had already gone on board.
Under these circumstances, Somers had not a moment to
see Langdon. He took possession of his state-room, and
at once had all the work he could do, in the discharge of
his duty.</p>

<p>At meridian the ensign was run up, and the ship went
into commission under the command of Captain Cascabel.
Mr. Pillgrim was doing duty as executive officer,
though a substitute for Mr. Waldron was expected before
the ship sailed. Somers was uneasy, and dissatisfied
with himself. He began to feel that he had left a duty
unperformed. He had intended to expose the conspiracy
before the Chatauqua sailed, and thus relieve himself
from the heavy responsibility that rested upon him. Yet<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
to whom could he speak? Mr. Waldron was still dangerously
ill. Mr. Pillgrim was evidently a traitor himself.</p>

<p>He could give his information to the United States
marshal at Philadelphia; but how could he prove his
allegations? Langdon and Coles he had not seen since
his return, and perhaps they were in another part of the
country by this time. He had the commander's commission
and the written orders, but in the absence of the
principals, he feared these would be better evidence
against himself than against the conspirators.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis had sailed, and the worst she could do
at present would be to run the blockade. The Chatauqua
was generally understood to be ordered to Mobile,
where the Ben Nevis was to run in, and fit out for her
piratical cruise. After a great deal of serious reflection,
Somers came to the unsatisfactory conclusion that he must
keep his secret. He could not denounce Mr. Pillgrim
as a rebel, with his present information, without exposing
himself to greater peril than the real criminal. Besides,
he was to be with the lieutenant, and he was going to
Mobile. He could watch the traitor, and await the
appearance of the Ben Nevis, when she arrived at the
station.</p>

<p>Somers was not satisfied with this conclusion, but his
judgment assured him his intended course of action was
the best the circumstances would admit. Thus settling
the question, he attended to his duty with his usual zeal
and energy.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE UNITED STATES STEAMER CHATAUQUA.</p>

<p>Somers had served in several vessels, but never
before had he gone on board his ship with a
heavier responsibility resting upon him, than
when he took his station on the deck of the Chatauqua.
He was now a ward-room officer, and as such he would
be required to keep a watch, and be in command of the
deck. But in addition to his professional duties, he had
in his keeping valuable but dangerous information, of
which he must make a judicious use.</p>

<p>The young officer was perfectly familiar with the routine
of his duties. He knew the ship from stem to stern,
and from keel to truck. He felt entirely at home, therefore,
and hoped soon to merit the approbation of his
superiors. He was formally presented to Captain Cascabel
and the other officers of the ship. He was kindly
and cordially greeted by all. Mr. Pillgrim, as acting
first lieutenant, proceeded at once to make out the watch,
quarter, and station bill; and, whatever his political
principles, it must be confessed that he performed this
difficult duty with skill and judgment.<span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>Every day, until the ship sailed, the crew were exercised
at the guns, and in all the evolutions required for
carrying on ship's duty, from "fire stations" to piping
down the hammocks. They made the usual proficiency,
and were soon in condition to work together&mdash;to handle
the ship in a tornado, or to meet an enemy. On the
fourth day, when Mr. Pillgrim was superseded by Mr.
Hackleford, who was appointed in the place of Mr. Waldron,
everything was in an advanced stage of progress.</p>

<p>The Chatauqua was a screw steam sloop of war, of
the first class. She carried ten guns, and was about
fourteen hundred tons burden. Her complement of officers
and men was about two hundred and fifty, including
forty-two attached to the engineer's department. The
ship was a two-decker. On the upper or spar deck was
placed her armament, consisting of two immense pivot
guns and eight broadside guns.</p>

<p>Below this was the berth deck, on which all the officers
and men ate and slept. The after part was appropriated
to the officers, and the forward part to the men.
The former were provided with cabins and state-rooms,
while the latter swung their hammocks to the deck
beams over their heads.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>As most of our readers have probably never seen the
interior of a ship of war, we present on the adjoining
page a plan of that portion of the vessel occupied by
the officers. The round part is the stern of the ship,
<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>and the diagram includes a little less than one third of
the whole length of the vessel.</p>

</p>

<p>In the floor of the ward-room, between the state-room,
8 and 12, there are two scuttles leading down to the
magazine, so that, during an action, all the powder is
passed up through this room. Woollen screens are hung
up on each side of these scuttles, when they are opened,
to prevent any spark from being carried down to the
powder.</p>

<p>There are four other scuttles leading down into the
hold from the ward-room to the various store-rooms located
there, and several in the floor abreast of the steerage.</p>

<p>On the forward part of the berth deck, just abaft the
foremast, there are four state-rooms for the use of the
carpenter, gunner, boatswain, and sailmaker. All persons
except those mentioned sleep in hammocks.</p>

<p>The engine department of the Chatauqua consisted of
one chief, two first assistant, two second assistant, and
one third assistant engineers, with eighteen firemen and
eighteen coal heavers. The chief engineer is a ward-room
officer. He has the sole charge of the engine, and
all persons connected with its management, but he keeps
no watch. The other engineers obey the orders of their
chief, and are divided into watches. They attend to the
actual working of the engine. The firemen are also<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
classified, and receive different grades of pay, a portion
of them attending to the oiling of the machinery,&mdash;called
"oilers,"&mdash;while others superintend or feed the
fires, and do other work connected with the engine and
boilers. The coal-heavers convey the fuel from the coal
bunkers to the furnaces.</p>

<p>Mr. Ensign Somers was the fourth lieutenant of the
Chatauqua, and occupied the last state-room on the left,
as you enter the ward-room. It was a nice little apartment,
and the young officer was as happy as a lord when
he was fully installed in his new quarters. And well
might one who had commenced his naval career as an
ordinary seaman, sleeping in a hammock, and who had
never before known anything better than the confined
accommodations of the steerage, have been delighted
with his present comfortable and commodious quarters.</p>

<p>His state-room was lighted by a bull's eye, or round
glass window, which could be opened in port, or in pleasant
weather at sea. The room contained but one berth,
which was quite wide for a ship, supplied with an excellent
mattress; and one who could not sleep well in such
a bed must be troubled with a rebellious conscience.
There was also a bureau, the upper drawer of which,
when the front was dropped down, became a convenient
writing desk, supplied with small drawers, shelves, and
pigeon-holes. The room was carpeted, and contained
all that a reasonable man could require to make him
comfortable and happy.<span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>There was only one drawback upon the happiness of
Somers; and that was the absence of Mr. Waldron.
There was not one among the officers whom he could
now call by the endearing name of friend, though all of
them were good officers and gentlemanly men, and he
had no reason to anticipate any difficulty with any of
them, unless it was with Mr. Pillgrim. He sighed for
the friendly guidance and the genial companionship of
the late commander of the Rosalie, especially in view of
the embarrassing circumstances which surrounded him.</p>

<p>But it was some compensation to know that his old
shipmate, Tom Longstone, had been promoted to the
rank of boatswain, and ordered to the Chatauqua. The
old man's splendid behavior in Doboy Sound had enabled
Mr. Waldron to secure this favor for him, and to obtain
his appointment to his own ship. Mr. Longstone, as he
must hereafter be called, came on board in a uniform of
bright blue, and his dress so altered his appearance that
Somers hardly recognized him. The old salt had always
been very careful about "putting on airs," when he was
a common sailor or a petty officer; but he knew how to
be a gentleman, and his new dignity sat as easily upon
him as though he had been brought up in the ward-room.
Though he looked well, and carried himself like an officer,
he could not immediately adapt his language to his
new position. He was a representative sailor, and he
could not help being "salt."<span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>The boatswain was Somers's only real friend on board,
and the distance between a ward-room officer and a forward
officer was so great that he was not likely to realize
any especial satisfaction from the friendship; but it
was pleasant to know that there was even one in the ship
who was devoted to him, heart and soul.</p>

<p>"All hands, up anchor!" piped the boatswain; and it
was a pleasant sound to the fourth lieutenant of the Chatauqua,
as doubtless it was to all hands, for "lying in
the stream" is stupid work to an expectant crew.</p>

<p>The ship got under way with all the order and regularity
which prevail on board a man-of-war, and in a
short time was standing down the Delaware River. Her
great guns pealed the customary salute, and as the wind
was fair, her top-sails and top-gallant-sails were shaken
out as soon as she had passed from the narrow river into
the broad bay. Off the capes the sealed orders were
opened; and it proved, as the knowing ones had anticipated,
that the Chatauqua was bound to the blockading
station off Mobile Bay.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the evening the ship was out of
sight of land. Everything on board was in regular sea
trim. Mr. Garboard, the third lieutenant, had the deck,
and the other officers were in the ward-room, or in their
state-rooms. They were discussing the merits of the
ship, or the probable work before them at Mobile; for
a great naval attack in that quarter was confidently<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
predicted. The "Old Salamander," "Brave Old Salt,"
as Admiral Farragut was familiarly called, was understood
to be making preparations for one of his tremendous
onslaughts.</p>

<p>Somers was occupied in his state-room, putting his
books, papers, and clothing in order, which he had not
had time to do before to his satisfaction. He placed his
Testament on the bureau, where it could be taken up for
a moment without delay, and where it would constantly
remind him of his duty, and of the loved ones at home,
with whom the precious volume seemed to be inseparably
associated.</p>

<p>Among his papers were the rebel commission, the
written orders, and the statement he had made of the
interview between Coles and Langdon, which had been
extended so as to contain a full account of his conference
with "Mr. Wynkoop," and his inquiries into the character
of the Ben Nevis, in Boston and New York. These
documents brought forcibly to his mind his relations with
Lieutenant Pillgrim, who was still a mystery to him.
Since Somers had come on board of the Chatauqua, not
a syllable had been breathed about the dinner with the
"officer of the royal navy." As Mr. Pillgrim doubtless
believed he had changed the letters, and thus corrected
his confederate's mistake, before the letter intended for
him had fallen into Somers's hand, the lieutenant had no
reason to suppose his treasonable position was even suspected.<span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>Somers felt that he had a battle to fight with Mr. Pillgrim,
and the suspense was intolerable, not to mention
the hypocrisy and deceit which this double character required
of him. Now, more than before, he regretted the
absence of Mr. Waldron, who would have been a rock
of safety and strength to him in the trials that beset him.
While he was moodily overhauling his papers, and thinking
of his difficult situation, Mr. Pillgrim knocked at the
door of his room, and was invited to enter.</p>

<p>"Ah, making stowage, are you, Somers?" said the
lieutenant, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; putting things to rights a little."</p>

<p>"It's a good plan to have everything in its place,"
added Pillgrim, as he took up the little Testament which
lay on the bureau. "You are a good boy, I see, and
read the book."</p>

<p>"That was given me by my mother, and I value it
very highly."</p>

<p>"Then I shouldn't think you would want to wear it
out."</p>

<p>"She gave it to me to use, and I am afraid, if she
saw it was not soiled by handling, she would think it had
not been well used."</p>

<p>"I am glad you use it. I don't fail to read mine
morning and evening."</p>

<p>Somers could not believe him, and he could not see
that a traitor to his country should have any use for the
New Testament.<span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>"By the way, Somers, did you see your friend Wynkoop
again before we sailed?" added Mr. Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"I did not; I have not seen him since we dined together.
I judge that you were better acquainted with
him than I was."</p>

<p>"My acquaintance with him was very slight. By the
papers I saw on the table before you, when you were at
dinner, I think you made good use of the short time you
knew each other."</p>

<p>"To what do you allude?" asked Somers, now assured
that Mr. Pillgrim knew the nature of the papers.</p>

<p>"To your commission as a commander in the Confederate
navy. Mr. Somers, I could not believe my eyes."</p>

<p>"Were you very much astonished?"</p>

<p>"If I had been told that President Lincoln had gone
over to the rebels, I should not have been more astonished.
Your conduct has severely embarrassed me. It
was my duty to denounce you as a traitor, in the service
of the enemy, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant the rattle of the drum, beating to quarters,
caused both of them to hurry on deck.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="h3">IN THE STATE-ROOM.</p>

<p>Somers took his station on the quarter deck,
near the mizzen-mast, while Mr. Pillgrim went
forward to the forecastle. The guns were cast
loose, and the crew exercised at quarters for a few
moments, just as though there were an enemy's ship
near. This man&oelig;uvre was executed for the purpose of
perfecting the officers and crew in discipline; and it is
not an uncommon thing to turn up all hands in the dead
of the night for this object, for it is easier to correct mistakes
at such times than when in the presence of the
enemy. As there was no Confederate ship in sight, all
hands were presently piped below, and Somers returned
to his state-room, where he was soon joined by Mr. Pillgrim,
who evidently wished to prolong the conversation
which had been commenced before the ship beat to quarters.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers you and I have been friends for some
little time," the lieutenant began, "and I confess that I
have been deeply interested in you, not only on your own
account, but for the sake of our friends at Newport."<span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Pillgrim," said Somers, as the gentleman
paused. "I am greatly obliged to you, and I
hope I shall always merit your good opinion."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, my young friend; at least, you have
not commenced this cruise very well, having first sold
yourself to the enemy."</p>

<p>"Do you think I have done that, Mr. Pillgrim?" demanded
Somers, not a little excited by the charge, from
such a source.</p>

<p>"I know you have. I saw your commission on the
table."</p>

<p>"I took the commission, I grant, but I have no intention
of using it."</p>

<p>"Why did you take it then?"</p>

<p>"For the purpose of gaining information."</p>

<p>"Have you gained it?" demanded Mr. Pillgrim, with
a hardly perceptible sneer.</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"You received written orders, also."</p>

<p>"I did; and if I had obtained a foothold on the deck
of the vessel to which I was ordered, you would have
seen how quick I should have passed her over to my
government."</p>

<p>"That is a very plausible explanation, Mr. Somers,"
added the lieutenant. "But why did you sign the oath of
allegiance to the Southern Confederacy?"</p>

<p>"I did not."<span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but I saw the document with
your signature affixed to it."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Mr. Pillgrim."</p>

<p>"Can I refuse to believe the evidence of my own
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I must persist in saying that I did not
sign the oath."</p>

<p>"After what you have done, Mr. Somers, I could
hardly expect you to acknowledge it to a loyal officer.
Are you aware that any court martial would convict you,
on the evidence against you, of treason, and sentence
you to death?"</p>

<p>"I think not, when it was made to appear that all I
did was in the service of my country."</p>

<p>Somers shuddered when he thought of a traitor's
doom, and for the first time realized that he had accumulated
more evidence against himself than against the
conspirators. The commander's commission and the
written orders were almost, if not quite, enough to hang
him.</p>

<p>"You don't believe what you say, Mr. Somers, and of
course you cannot expect me to believe it," said Pillgrim,
when he saw his brother officer musing, and looking
rather anxious.</p>

<p>"I speak the truth, Mr. Pillgrim," replied Somers,
unable to turn his attention entirely away from the consequences
which might follow some of these appearances
against him.<span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>"Somers, I have felt a deep interest in you. I have
all along desired to be your friend. This is the only
reason why I did not prefer charges against you before
the ship sailed. Now, I advise you not to deny what is
as plain as truth can make it. I am your friend. Own
up to me, and I promise never to betray you."</p>

<p>"Would your friend Langdon, <i>alias</i> Lieutenant Wynkoop,
R. N., be equally considerate?" asked Somers,
provoked into making this unguarded remark by the
hypocrisy of Pillgrim.</p>

<p>If the second lieutenant of the Chatauqua had received
the bolt from a thunder cloud he could not have been
more astonished. He started back, turned pale, and
quivered with emotion.</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded he, with a tremendous effort to
recover his self-possession.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Mr. Pillgrim, that I am a little lamb,
that can be led round with a silken string?" replied
Somers, with energy. "You are my superior officer,
and as such I will respect and obey you until&mdash;until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until what?"</p>

<p>"Until the day of reckoning comes. When you stand
up in my presence and charge me with being a traitor to
my country, you had better remember that such charges,
like chickens, will go home to roost."</p>

<p>"I was not brought up in a barn yard, Mr. Somers,
and such comparisons are beyond my comprehension."<span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>"Wherever you were brought up, I think my language
is plain enough to be understood by a person of your
intelligence."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was fortunate for both parties that a knock
at the state-room door disturbed the conference at this
exciting moment. Somers opened the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hackleford desires to see Mr. Somers on deck,"
said a midshipman.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for a few moments, Mr. Pillgrim," said
Somers, as he closed his desk and locked it.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir; but I should be happy to see you
when you are disengaged. I will remain here if you
please."</p>

<p>"I will join you as soon as I can."</p>

<p>It was warm below, and both Pillgrim and Somers
had thrown off their coats, and laid them on the bed.
Somers slipped on his own, as he supposed, and hastened
on deck to meet the first lieutenant. The garment seemed
rather large for him, and there were several papers in
the breast pocket which did not belong to him. Then he
was aware that he had taken the second lieutenant's coat
instead of his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackleford wished to obtain some information
from him in regard to one of the petty officers, and when
Somers had answered the questions he went below again.
The papers in the pocket of Pillgrim's coat seemed to
burn his fingers when he touched them. The owner was<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
a traitor, and perhaps these documents might contain
valuable intelligence. Under ordinary circumstances it
would have been the height of perfidy to look at one of
them; but, in the present instance, he felt justified in
glancing at them. The state-room of the second assistant
engineers was open and lighted, but neither of these
officers was there. Stepping into the room, he opened
the papers and glanced at their contents. Only one of
them contained anything of importance. This was a
note from a person who signed himself simply "Irvine,"
but it was in the handwriting of Langdon. The only
clause in the epistle that was intelligible to Somers was
this: "Have just heard from B&mdash;&mdash;. The Ben Nevis,
he says, will make Wilmington after leaving St. John.
Plenty of guns there. She will sail July 4."</p>

<p>Whether "B&mdash;&mdash;" meant Boston or some person's name,
Somers could not determine; but the fact in regard to
the Ben Nevis was of the utmost consequence. Hastily
folding up the note, he returned the package of papers
to the pocket where he had found them. Taking off the
coat as he entered the ward-room, he went into the state-room,
where Mr. Pillgrim was still waiting for him, with
the garment on his arm. He threw it upon the bed as
he entered, and his companion was not even aware of
the mistake which had been made.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, you were making some grave charges
against me when you were called away," said the lieutenant.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>"Not half so grave as those you made against me,"
replied Somers.</p>

<p>"Those can be proved."</p>

<p>"I made no charges. I only mentioned the name of
your friend Langdon."</p>

<p>"I don't know him," added Pillgrim, doggedly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, as you did mine, just now."</p>

<p>"Which means that you doubt my word."</p>

<p>"As you did mine."</p>

<p>"Somers, I am not to be trifled with," said Pillgrim,
sternly.</p>

<p>"Neither am I."</p>

<p>"Be cautious, or I will denounce you to the captain at
once," added the lieutenant, in low and threatening tones.</p>

<p>"Proceed, and then I shall be at liberty to take the
next step."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I intend to show you my hand?" said
Somers, with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>Pillgrim bit his lip with vexation. He seemed to be
completely cornered. He evidently believed that his
companion knew more than "the law allows."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim, I am no traitor; you know this as well
as I do. Whatever papers I took from your friend Langdon,
<i>alias</i> Wynkoop, were taken with a view to serve my
country."</p>

<p>"You signed the oath of allegiance he offered you."<span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>"It is false!" replied Somers, angrily.</p>

<p>"Be calm, Mr. Somers. I am no hypocrite, as you
are," added Pillgrim. "I have heard that you have a
talent for overhearing other people's conversation."</p>

<p>"In the service of my country I am willing to do even
this," said Somers, indignantly.</p>

<p>"No matter about that. You have hinted that I am
a traitor."</p>

<p>"If the hint is not sufficient, I declare that such is
the fact."</p>

<p>Somers was roused to a high pitch of excitement, and
he was not as prudent as he was wont to be. He was
not playing a part now; he was talking and acting as he
wanted to talk and act. He was calling treason and
treachery by their right names.</p>

<p>"Explain, Mr. Somers," said Pillgrim, who grew
cooler as his companion became hotter.</p>

<p>"You are in league with the enemies of your country.
You and others have just started a steamer for St. John,
which you intend to fit out as a Confederate cruiser&mdash;the
Ben Nevis, of which you and your fellow-conspirators
did me the honor to give me the command."</p>

<p>Pillgrim smiled blandly.</p>

<p>"And you accepted the command?"</p>

<p>"For a purpose, I did."</p>

<p>"You have not explained why you connect me with
this affair. You spoke of some one whom you call
Langdon. I don't know him."<span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>"You&mdash;do!"</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"He addresses a note to you, calling you 'my dear
Pillgrim,' and signs himself, familiarly, 'Langdon.'"</p>

<p>"Then you have been reading my letters&mdash;have you?"</p>

<p>"It was addressed to me, and put in my box at the
hotel."</p>

<p>The second lieutenant turned pale, then red. He
walked up and down the state-room several times in
silence. He could not deny the fact alleged. While he
walked, Somers explained how he had read the note, and
then put it back in the box. Pillgrim understood it.</p>

<p>"Of course you know Coles," continued Somers,
placing a heavy emphasis on the name of this worthy.</p>

<p>The lieutenant halted before his companion, and looked
earnestly and inquiringly into his face. Somers returned
his gaze with unflinching resolution. There was a smile
upon his face, for he believed that he had thrown a red-hot
shot into the enemy.</p>

<p>"Coles!" said Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Coles!" repeated Somers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, you are a fool!"</p>

<p>"Pray, where were you when human wisdom was
distributed?"</p>

<p>"Do you know Coles?" asked Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"I think I should know Coles if I saw him."</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't."<span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>"He is the greatest villain that ever went unhung."</p>

<p>"Except yourself. Somers, this is child's play. You
have made me your enemy, but let us fight it out like
men."</p>

<p>"I will do so with pleasure when you take your place
on the deck of a rebel vessel, where you belong."</p>

<p>"A truce to child's play, I say again. We must settle
this matter here and now."</p>

<p>"It can't be done."</p>

<p>"It must be done, or I will inform Captain Cascabel
who and what you are before the first watch is out.
Probably he will wish to see your Confederate commission
and your letter of instructions."</p>

<p>"When he does, I have something else to show him,"
replied Somers, whose answer was sufficiently indefinite
to make the traitor look very stormy and anxious.</p>

<p>"Can you show him a Confederate oath of allegiance
signed by me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then he will be more likely to hear me than you,"
added the lieutenant, whose countenance now looked as
malignant as that of a demon. "You have subscribed
to that oath; I have not."</p>

<p>"It is false!"</p>

<p>"So you said before."</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"Here," continued Pillgrim, taking from his pocket<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
the document which had been offered to Somers by Wynkoop.</p>

<p>The young officer glanced at it, and on the line for the
signature, he saw, with horror and indignation, the name
of "John Somers," apparently in his own handwriting.
Undoubtedly it was a forgery, but it was so well done
that even the owner of the name could hardly distinguish
it from his usual signature.</p>

<p>"It is a forgery," gasped Somers, appalled at the
deadly peril which seemed to be in his path.</p>

<p>"Prove it," said the lieutenant, with a mocking smile.</p>

<p>Somers groaned in spirit. It would be impossible for
him to prove that the signature was a forgery. Even
his best friends would acknowledge it, so well was it
executed.</p>

<p>"I have you, Somers," said Pillgrim, exultingly.
"Let us understand each other. You are mine, Somers,
or you hang! Somers, I am Coles!"</p>

<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE CHIEF CONSPIRATOR.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pillgrim rattled off the sentences
in which he acknowledged his complicity
with treason with a smile of malignant triumph
on his face. He gloated over his victim as the evil
one might be supposed to do over a soul wrenched
from truth and virtue. He believed that he had Somers
in a position where he could not betray him, or even
resent his tyranny.</p>

<p>For the first time Somers realized that he had been
imprudent in exposing himself to the machinations of
these evil men. Before he had only felt a little uncomfortably,
and harbored a vague suspicion that, in attempting
to overreach others, he had committed himself. He
had learned in his babyhood that it is dangerous to play
with fire, but had never believed it so fully as at this
moment. He had touched the pitch, and felt that he
had been defiled by it. Though his conscience kept
assuring him he was innocent, and protesting against a
harsh judgment, he could not help regretting that he had<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
not exposed the villains before he left Philadelphia, and
permitted the consequences to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>But stronger than any other impression, at this eventful
moment, was the feeling that he was no match for
men so deeply versed in treason and wickedness as Pillgrim
and his confederates. He had played at the game
of strategy, and been beaten. While he thought he was
leading them on to confusion, they were actually entwining
the meshes of the net around him.</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim had just declared that he was the mysterious
Coles. Somers, at first, found it very difficult to
realize the fact. He had really seen Coles but once; but
they had spent some hours together. At that time Coles
wore long, black whiskers, which concealed two thirds of
his face; Pillgrim wore no beard, not even a mustache.
Coles was dressed in homely garments; Pillgrim, in an
elegant uniform. Coles's hair was short and straight;
Pillgrim's, long and curly at the ends.</p>

<p>In height, form, and proportions, they were the same;
and the difference between Coles and Pillgrim was really
nothing which might not have been produced with a
razor, a pair of barber's shears, and the contrast of dress.
The familiarity of the lieutenant's expression, before unexplained,
was now accounted for; and before his tyrant
spoke again, Somers was satisfied that he actually stood
in the presence of Coles.</p>

<p>Pillgrim stood with folded arms, gazing at his victim,<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
and enjoying the confusion which Somers could not conceal.
The persecutor was a confident man, and fully
believed that he was master of the situation, and that
Somers would do anything he asked of him, even to
going over into the rebel ranks. He was mistaken; for
Somers, deep as he felt that he was in hot water, would
have chosen to hang at the fore yard-arm, rather than
betray his country, or be false to her interests.</p>

<p>"You just now remarked that you should know Coles
if you saw him," sneered Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"I know you now," replied Somers, bitterly.</p>

<p>"I see you do; but you will know me better before
we part."</p>

<p>"I know you well enough now. You are a rebel and
a traitor; and what I said of Coles I say of you,&mdash;that
you are the greatest villain that ever went unhung."</p>

<p>"I don't like that kind of language, Mr. Somers,"
replied Pillgrim, with entire coolness and self-possession.
"It isn't the kind of language which one gentleman
should apply to another."</p>

<p>"Gentleman!" said Somers, with curling lip; "I
applied it to a rebel and a traitor."</p>

<p>"In the present instance it is mutiny. I am your
superior officer."</p>

<p>"You are out of place; you don't belong here."</p>

<p>"Your place is on the quarter deck of the Ben Nevis;
and perhaps it will be when she goes into commission as
a Confederate cruiser."<span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Somers, with energy.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Somers, be prudent. Some of the
officers might hear you."</p>

<p>"I don't care if they all hear me."</p>

<p>"You talk and act like a boy, Somers. I beg you to
consider that your neck and mine are in the same noose.
If I hang, you hang with me."</p>

<p>Somers groaned, for he could not see where his vindication
was to come from.</p>

<p>"You seem to understand your situation, and at the
same time you appear to be quite willing to throw yourself
into the fire. Let me call your attention to the fact
that fire will burn."</p>

<p>"Better burn or hang, than be a traitor."</p>

<p>"Be reasonable, Somers. I do not propose to ask
anything of you which will compromise your position in
the navy; but I repeat, you are mine."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"I have told you my secret. You know that I am in
the Confederate service; that I have fitted out a vessel to
cruise for Yankee ships. I am willing you should know
this, for you dare not violate my confidence."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I dare."</p>

<p>"If you do, you are a dead man."</p>

<p>"Will you kill me?"</p>

<p>"If necessary."</p>

<p>"I have usually been able to defend myself," replied
Somers, with dignity.<span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>"I am not an assassin. A court martial will do all I
wish done if you are not prudent and devoted, as you
should be. The Confederate oath of allegiance signed by
you is good testimony."</p>

<p>"I didn't sign it. The signature is a forgery."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, what possible difference does that
make? It is well done&mdash;is it not?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"Langdon gave it to me."</p>

<p>"Did he sign my name to it?"</p>

<p>"Possibly; but even grant that I did it myself&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"You are a greater villain than I ever gave Coles
the credit of being."</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"Where is Langdon now?"</p>

<p>"In New York&mdash;where he can be reached if you
make it necessary to convene a court martial."</p>

<p>"Is he a naval officer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has been a Confederate agent in London for
the past two years. Since the English have become a
little particular about letting steamers out for the Confederates,
he buys them on this side."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me, Mr.&mdash;Pillgrim? if that is
your name?"</p>

<p>"That is my name. I don't want much of you."</p>

<p>"What?"<span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>"I am not ready to tell you until you are in a proper
frame of mind. You are rather childish to-night. After
you have thought the matter over, you will be a man,
and be reasonable. Let me see: Garboard has the
forenoon watch to-morrow, and we shall both be off duty
after general quarters. If you please, I will meet you
at that time."</p>

<p>Somers considered a moment, and assented to the
proposition. Pillgrim bade him good night, and retired
to his own state-room, apparently without a fear that his
victim would struggle in the trap into which he had
fallen.</p>

<p>"And into the counsels of the ungodly enter thou not."
This text rang in the mind of Somers, as though some
mighty prophet were thundering it into his ears. He
felt that he had already plunged deep enough into the pit
of treason, and he was anxious to get away from it
before he was scorched by the fire, and before the smell
of fire clung to his garments.</p>

<p>For half an hour the fourth lieutenant of the Chatauqua
sat at his desk, in deep thought. Though in the
matter of which he was thinking, he had not sinned
against his country, or the moral law, he was sorely
troubled. He could not conceal from himself the fact
that he was afraid of Pillgrim. The dread of having his
name connected with any treasonable transaction was
hard to overcome. That oath of allegiance, with his<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
signature forged upon it, haunted him like an evil demon.
He felt more timid and fearful than ever before in
his life. His faith in Him who doeth all things well,
seemed to be momentarily shaken, and he was hardly
willing to do justly, and leave the consequences to
themselves.</p>

<p>He felt weak, and being conscious of his weakness, he
looked upward for strength. Leaning on his desk, he
prayed for wisdom to know the right, and for the power
to do it. He was in earnest; and though his prayer was
not spoken, it moved his soul down to the depths of his
spiritual being.</p>

<p>Three bells struck while he was thus engaged. He
rose from the desk, and walked up and down the state-room
several times. Suddenly he stopped short. A
great thought struck him. In an instant it became a
great resolution. Before it had time to grow cold, he
put on his coat and cap, and went out into the ward-room.
Mr. Transit, the master, Mr. Grynbock, the
paymaster, and Dr. De Plesion, the surgeon, were there,
discussing the anticipated attacks on Mobile and Wilmington.
Somers felt no interest in the conversation at
this time. He went on deck, where he found Captain
Cascabel and the first lieutenant, smoking their cigars.
Waiting till the captain went below, he touched his cap
to Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers?"<span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Not turned in, Mr. Somers? You have the mid-watch."</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me, sir, for coming to you at such
a time, I wish to have half an hour's conversation with
you."</p>

<p>"With me?" said Mr. Hackleford, apparently much
surprised at such a request at such an hour.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It is a matter of the utmost consequence,
or I would not have mentioned it at this time."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Somers; I am ready to hear you."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir; I would rather not introduce the
matter on deck."</p>

<p>"Well, come to my state-room."</p>

<p>"To my state-room, if you please, Mr. Hackleford."</p>

<p>"Why not mine?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid the person most deeply concerned will
overhear me. His room is next to yours."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim?" exclaimed the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I have a high regard for you as an
officer and a gentleman, and I am not unacquainted
with your past history. I hope you have nothing to say
which will reflect on a brother officer."</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I advise you to think well before you speak."</p>

<p>"I am entirely prepared to speak, sir."<span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>"Complaints against superior officers, Mr. Somers,
are rather dangerous."</p>

<p>"It is not personal, sir, though I may be the sufferer
for making it."</p>

<p>Mr. Hackleford led the way down to the ward-room.
The officers had retired to their apartments, and there
was no one to see them enter the state-room. As
it was now nearly ten o'clock, when all officers' lights
must be extinguished, Somers formally asked and obtained
permission to burn his lamp till eleven o'clock.
The first lieutenant entered the room, and Somers closed
the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hackleford, may I trouble you to read this
statement?" said Somers, as he handed out the paper he
had so carefully prepared.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant adjusted his eye-glass, and read
the statement through, asking an explanation of two or
three points as he proceeded. He was deeply absorbed
in the narrative, which was drawn up with the utmost
minuteness.</p>

<p>"This is an infernal scheme, Mr. Somers. I hope
you did not permit the vessel to sail without giving
information of her character."</p>

<p>"The Ben Nevis sailed from New York before I could
do anything or say a word," said Somers, exhibiting
Langdon's letter.</p>

<p>"That was bad. You should have spoken before."<span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>"My paper explains my reasons for keeping still.
Perhaps I was wrong, sir, but I did the best I knew
how."</p>

<p>"And this vessel is bound to Mobile. We may pick
her up."</p>

<p>"The note says she is bound to Mobile; but it is not
true. That is a blind to deceive me."</p>

<p>"Why should they wish to deceive you, after giving
you their confidence."</p>

<p>"I don't know the reason."</p>

<p>"But what has all this to do with Mr. Pillgrim?"
asked Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim is the person spoken of in that paper
as Coles."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" ejaculated Mr. Hackleford, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>"I shall be able to prove it by to-morrow, sir."</p>

<p>Somers then gave him the substance of the conversation
between himself and Mr. Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Why, this Coles wants something of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I don't know what. He engaged to
meet me here at four bells in the forenoon watch to-morrow,
when he will tell me what he wants."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Somers; meet him as agreed. You
have played your part well. When you come together,
you must yield the point; lead him along, and you will
bag him,&mdash;and the vessel, I hope."<span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>"The Ben Nevis will sail from St. John July 4, for
Wilmington."</p>

<p>"Ah, then she is about even with the Chatauqua. I
would give a year's pay for the privilege of catching her."</p>

<p>Until eleven o'clock the two officers consulted charts,
and figured up the time of the Ben Nevis.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="h3">AFTER GENERAL QUARTERS.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock, when the master-at-arms
knocked at the door of the fourth lieutenant,
to inform him that it was time to put out his
light, the calculations in regard to the position
of the Ben Nevis had been made and verified. Mr.
Hackleford, after counselling prudence and precaution,
retired to his state-room. Somers threw himself on his
cot, and having eased his mind of the heavy burden
which had rested upon it, he went to sleep. But there
was only an hour of rest for him, for at twelve o'clock
he was to take the deck.</p>

<p>When eight bells struck, he turned out, much refreshed
by his short nap, to relieve Mr. Garboard. It
was a beautiful night, with only a gentle breeze from the
westward, and the ship was doing her ten knots without
making any fuss about it. Somers took the trumpet,
which the officer of the deck always carries as the
emblem of his office, and commenced his walk on the
weather side.<span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>Though he carefully watched the compasses, and saw
that the sheets were hauled close home, he could not help
thinking of the startling events which had transpired on
the preceding evening. But he was satisfied with himself
now. He had purged himself of all appearance of
complicity with the enemies of his country, and he fully
expected that Pillgrim would be put under arrest within
the next forty-eight hours. The consciousness of duty
done made him happy and contented. The first lieutenant
had even praised him for the manner in which he
had conducted the delicate business, and did not lay
any stress on the oath of allegiance, or the commander's
commission.</p>

<p>For his four hours he "planked the deck," thinking of
the past and hopeful of the future. At eight bells he
sent a midshipman down to call Mr. Pillgrim. While he
was waiting to be relieved, he could not help considering
what a risk it was to leave that noble ship in the hands
of a traitor; but Somers had given all the information he
had to Mr. Hackleford, and the responsibility did not
rest upon himself. The first lieutenant was an able and
discreet officer, and would not permit the Chatauqua to
be imperilled even for a moment.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Somers," said Lieutenant Pillgrim,
as he came on deck.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Pillgrim," replied Somers, with
all the courtesy due to the quarter deck.<span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>"A fine morning."</p>

<p>"Beautiful weather."</p>

<p>"You have had a good opportunity to think over our
business. How do you feel about it?"</p>

<p>"Just right, I hope."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. Have you seen anything of
the Ben Nevis?"</p>

<p>"Of the Ben Nevis! No, sir; I don't expect to see
her here."</p>

<p>"We may," replied Pillgrim, as he took the trumpet.</p>

<p>"Isn't she going to Mobile?"</p>

<p>"We'll talk of her during the forenoon watch," added
the second lieutenant, as he turned on his heel and
walked forward.</p>

<p>Somers went below. As he entered the ward-room,
Mr. Hackleford came out of his state-room. This gentleman
evidently intended to keep a sharp lookout for the
officer of the deck during his watch. He asked the
relieved officer if anything more had transpired, and the
unimportant conversation which had just taken place was
fully reported to him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I haven't slept an hour during the night.
There are one or two points in your statement which
were a little dark to me," said Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"More than that of it is dark to me. I do not profess
to understand the whole of it. I only state the facts
from my own point of view."<span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>"You listened to this talk between Coles and Langdon
at the sailors' boarding-house in Front Street?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"If you saw Coles there, how could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him, sir; I only heard him."</p>

<p>"That accounts for it," said Mr. Hackleford, musing.
"Didn't you recognize Mr. Pillgrim's voice?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I think he changed it; though the two
tones were so similar that I might have recognized it, if
I had suspected they were the same person."</p>

<p>Mr. Hackleford asked other questions, which Somers
answered with strict regard to the truth, rather than with
the intention of removing the first lieutenant's doubts.
He wanted only facts himself, and he was careful not to
distort them, in order to confirm any theory of his own
or of his superior officer.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackleford went on deck, and Somers turned in.
He was in condition to sleep now, and he improved his
four hours below to the best advantage.</p>

<p>After general quarters, when the crew were dismissed,
he went down to his state-room, prepared to meet Mr.
Pillgrim. He was surprised to know how little curiosity
he felt to learn what the traitor wanted and expected of
him. Punctual to the appointed time, which exhibited
the interest he felt in the expected interview, the treacherous
second lieutenant made his appearance. Somers
received him as one officer should receive another,<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
though it was hard work for him to disguise the contempt
and detestation with which he regarded the traitor.</p>

<p>"Well, Somers, now I am to tell you what I want of
you. It isn't much, as I warned you before; and I am
very glad to see that you are in such a happy frame of
mind."</p>

<p>"I am ready to hear you, and do the best I can," replied
Somers, carefully following the instructions of Mr.
Hackleford with regard to matter and manner.</p>

<p>He had been cautioned to be ready enough in listening
to the chief conspirator, but not too ready, so as to betray
his object.</p>

<p>"Good! I think you understand me now."</p>

<p>"I think I do, sir."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to do it, but it is necessary for me to
remind you again that your fate is in my hands; that a
word from me would subject you to a trial by court
martial for treason, and probably to more hemp rope
than would feel good about your neck."</p>

<p>"Though I don't think I am in so much danger as
you represent, I will grant your position."</p>

<p>"Don't grant it, if you think it is not correct;" and
Mr. Pillgrim minutely detailed the evidence which could
be brought to bear against him.</p>

<p>Somers appeared to be overwhelmed by this array of
testimony. He groaned, looked hopeless, and finally
granted the traitor's position in full.<span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>"I am in your power. Do with me as you will. Of
course the moment I put my foot on a rebel deck I am
ruined."</p>

<p>"You can do as you please about going into the Confederate
service. What I want of you will not compromise
you as a loyal man in the slightest degree."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so loud, if you please, Mr. Somers," said
the lieutenant, glancing at the door. "To me, Somers,
you have been a thorn. You lost me the Snowden, and
the valuable cargo of the Theban."</p>

<p>"I only did my duty," pleaded Somers.</p>

<p>"Bah! don't use that word to me again. Through
you a fortune slipped through my fingers. I should have
got the Snowden into Wilmington, if you had not meddled
with the matter. I have lost eighty thousand dollars
by you."</p>

<p>"Of course I had no ill will against you personally."</p>

<p>"Very true; if you had, you would have been a dead
man before this time. Phil Kennedy was a fool, but he
was my best friend. I have his bond for forty thousand
dollars, which is waste paper just now. Phil fell by
your hand."</p>

<p>"It was in fair fight."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! What matter is it to me how he fell,
whether it was in fair fight or foul? He is dead; that
is all."<span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>"What has all this to do with me?" asked Somers,
with seeming impatience.</p>

<p>"Much, my dear fellow. Phil was to marry Kate
Portington; was to pocket her fortune. You have cut
him out. You will marry her, and in due time come
into possession of a million. The commodore is apoplectic,
and will not live many years. Do you see my
point?"</p>

<p>"I do not," answered Somers, disgusted with this
heartless statement.</p>

<p>"As you cheated me out of the Snowden, as you
killed Phil Kennedy, as you will marry Kate Portington,
I propose that you assume and pay Phil's bond."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;you; Mr. Somers; Kate's prodigy,"
laughed Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Somers, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>"You speak too loud, Mr. Somers."</p>

<p>"Am I a dog, or a snake, or a toad, that I should do
such an unclean thing?"</p>

<p>The traitor took from his pocket the oath of allegiance,
opened it, and in silence thrust it into his companion's
face.</p>

<p>"I have sold myself."</p>

<p>"You have, Somers. Think of it. If I have to make
out a case against you, of course you will never see Kate
again. Let me add, that the commodore sets his life by<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
me. We were old friends before the war. You may
marry his daughter with my consent, but not without it."</p>

<p>"I never thought of such a thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. We waste time. Will you sign the
bond?"</p>

<p>"The bond is good for nothing. No court&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is my affair. If you agree to it, I will run all
risks. I trouble no courts. If you don't pay, I have
only to speak, and hang you then."</p>

<p>"I am lost," groaned Somers.</p>

<p>"No, you are not. Sign, and you have found fortune
and a friend."</p>

<p>"I dare not sign."</p>

<p>"You dare not refuse."</p>

<p>Somers walked up and down the state-room, apparently
in great mental agony.</p>

<p>"Shall I sign?" said he, in a loud tone, as though he
were speaking to the empty air.</p>

<p>"Not so loud, man!" interposed Pillgrim, angrily.</p>

<p>At that instant two light raps were distinctly heard.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded the traitor, greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"I will sign it," promptly added Somers, to whom the
two raps seemed to be perfectly intelligible.</p>

<p>"What was that noise?" asked Pillgrim, fearfully.
"Is there any one in Garboard's state-room?"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>The second lieutenant was not satisfied. He opened<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
the door and looked into the adjoining state-room, but
there was no person there, and the ward-room was
empty. There was no one within hearing, and the conspirator
recovered his wonted self-possession.</p>

<p>"You will sign?" said he.</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"I knew you would, and therefore I prepared the document;
read it," he continued, taking a paper from his
pocket.</p>

<p>Somers read. It was simply an agreement to pay
forty thousand dollars, when he married Kate Portington,
in consideration of certain assistance rendered the
signer, but without any allusion to the circumstances
under which it was given. As a legal document, of
course it was good for nothing, as both parties well
understood. Somers signed it.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Somers, we are friends," said Pillgrim,
as he folded up the paper, and restored it to his pocket.
"You have done me a good turn, and I have done you
one."</p>

<p>Somers, unwilling to regard Pillgrim as a fool, believed
that this paper was intended to ruin him in the
estimation of the Portington family, and that the villain
intended to marry her himself when her apparent suitor
was disposed of.</p>

<p>"Is this all you expect of me?" asked Somers.</p>

<p>"This is the principal thing. I may have occasion to<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
use you again; if I do, I shall not hesitate to call upon
you. You are in my confidence now."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, then, where the Ben Nevis is
bound? I may want to find her, for I haven't much
taste for the old navy now."</p>

<p>"Ah, you make better progress than I anticipated.
She is bound to St. Marks."</p>

<p>This was a lie, as Somers well knew.</p>

<p>"Coles and Langdon said she was to make Mobile."</p>

<p>"The plan was changed. You must not lay much
stress on what you heard that night. It was all a blind,&mdash;or
most of it was."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"The conversation at the house in Front Street was
carried on for your especial benefit," added Pillgrim,
laughing and rubbing his hands. "Langdon wrote both
letters about the wounded sailor; there was no such person.
The old woman that kept the house was in my
pay. When I spoke so warmly in your praise to Langdon,
I knew that you were listening to all I said; indeed,
I said it to you rather than to Langdon."</p>

<p>"Why did you tell me beforehand, if you intended to
catch me with the treasonable offer?" asked Somers,
rather mortified to learn that he had been duped from
the beginning.</p>

<p>"I knew you would pretend to accept it. All I
wanted was to get you to take the commission, orders,<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
and oath. As you agreed to sign the latter, Langdon
did it for you, for I could not wait."</p>

<p>"The Ben Nevis is no humbug?"</p>

<p>"No; I bought her and two other steamers on the
Clyde, in Scotland. The Ben Nevis was captured, but
my friends bought her after she was condemned. As
there had been a great deal said about her in the newspapers,
I used her because it was probable you had
heard of her."</p>

<p>"I had."</p>

<p>"Everything works as I intended."</p>

<p>"Not exactly," thought Somers.</p>

<p>"The captain of the coaster that pounded you that
night was Langdon," laughed Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Why was that done?"</p>

<p>"That I might take you back to the hotel, and be
your friend. We did not intend to hurt you much. It
was important that you should think well of me. You
do&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"All right now; remember you are mine, Somers,"
said Pillgrim, as he left the room.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BEN NEVIS.</p>

<p>The Chatauqua rolled along easily on her course
during the rest of the day, until the dog watch,
when Mr. Pillgrim had the deck again. Somers,
having discharged his whole duty in reference to the conspiracy,
was content to leave the matter in the hands of
Mr. Hackleford, to whom he had committed it.</p>

<p>At eight bells, as soon as Somers had been relieved
from the afternoon watch, he was not a little surprised to
receive a message from the captain, inviting him to his
cabin. He readily came to the conclusion that the summons
related to the conspiracy. When he entered the
cabin, he saw Captain Cascabel and Mr. Hackleford
seated at the table, on which was spread a general chart
of the coast of the United States.</p>

<p>"Say what you wish to Mr. Somers," said the captain
to the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, Captain Cascabel has sent for you in
relation to the affair of which we talked in your state-room
last night," Mr. Hackleford began. "All that you<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
have written out in your statement, and all that you told
me, have been fully confirmed."</p>

<p>"I intended to confine myself strictly to the facts,"
replied Somers, modestly.</p>

<p>"You have been very discreet and very prudent,"
added Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"I fully concur," said Captain Cascabel. "You have
exposed yourself to no little peril, in your zeal to serve
your country."</p>

<p>Somers bowed and blushed.</p>

<p>"I confess that I had some doubts in regard to the
result of your operations, Mr. Somers," continued the
first lieutenant; "but I am entirely satisfied now that
Mr. Pillgrim is just what you represent him to be."</p>

<p>"All that you affirmed has been fully verified," added
the captain.</p>

<p>He did not say that both himself and Mr. Hackleford
had listened to the entire conversation between Somers
and the traitor in the forenoon, occupying one of the
captain's state-rooms, which adjoined the starboard side
of the ward-room, having bored a couple of holes through
the partition, behind the bureau; he did not say this,
for it was hardly dignified for a captain to play the eavesdropper,
even in a good cause. Somers knew that Mr.
Hackleford was at hand at the time, and had arranged a
set of signals by which he could advise the young officer,
if he should be in doubt. One rap meant, "No;" two<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
raps, "Yes;" and three raps, "Give no direct answer."
When Somers was in doubt respecting the bond, he
asked the question of the empty air, apparently, but
really of Mr. Hackleford, who had promptly replied in
the affirmative by giving the two knocks, which had
startled the traitor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, what do you know of the Ben Nevis?"
asked the captain.</p>

<p>"She was to sail from St. John on the 4th of July,
to run the blockade at Wilmington. She is said to make
sixteen knots, under favorable circumstances."</p>

<p>"She has had a head wind part of the time. If she
has made twelve on the average, she has done well," said
Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"She will be due off Cape Fear some time after
meridian to-morrow," added the captain, consulting a
paper, on which were several arithmetical operations.</p>

<p>The calculations were carefully reviewed, and Somers
was questioned at considerable length; but he had
already given all the information he possessed. It was
evidently the intention of Captain Cascabel to capture
the Ben Nevis, though he did not announce his purpose.</p>

<p>"After what has occurred, Mr. Somers, you may be
surprised that Mr. Pillgrim has not been relieved from
duty and placed under arrest," continued Captain Cascabel,
after the position of the Ben Nevis had been carefully
estimated.<span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>"I leave the matter entirely in the hands of my
superior officers," replied Somers. "Having cast the
responsibility upon them, I am willing to obey orders
without asking any questions."</p>

<p>"That is a very proper view to take of the subject,
and I commend your moderation," said the captain, with
a pleasant smile. "It has been thought best not to disturb
Mr. Pillgrim for a day or two, for other events may
transpire."</p>

<p>Captain Cascabel bowed to Somers, and intimated that
he had no further need of him at present.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Somers, been visiting the captain," said
the second lieutenant, as his victim came on deck.</p>

<p>"I was sent for."</p>

<p>"What was the business?"</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mr. Transit, who was planking the deck
on the lee side, approached near enough to enable Somers
to avoid answering the question, and he thus escaped the
necessity of telling a falsehood. But as soon as Mr.
Garboard took the deck, Pillgrim repeated the inquiry,
and the young officer was obliged to narrate an imaginary
conversation.</p>

<p>"It's no matter, Somers. You understand that I
have a rope round your neck, and I am not at all afraid
that you will make an improper use of your tongue."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall not," answered Somers, with emphasis.
"You may depend upon me for that."<span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>"The fact is, Somers, I have got a mortgage on you;
and I want no better security for your good conduct."</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble yourself at all about me."</p>

<p>"I shall not; because, if you wish to betray me, I
should rather enjoy it. I have been your best friend.
Instead of blowing your brains out for making an end
of poor Phil Kennedy, I have taken you into my confidence.
You shall marry the prettiest and the richest
girl north of the Potomac; and when Union officers are
proscribed and condemned after the war, you will have
a friend at court who will speak a good word for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you; but do you really believe that the South
will carry the day?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it. England is our best friend; and
Louis Napoleon, in order to complete his Mexican
scheme, must recognize the Confederacy. When France
does the job, England will be only one day behind her."</p>

<p>"If I go with you, I shall be on the winning side,
then."</p>

<p>"If you do? You have gone with me. Though I
don't ask you to help the South openly, I expect you to
be a friend of the government which must soon rule the
country. Leave it all to me, Somers, and I will manage
the business for you and myself. You must confess,
Somers, that I am a little ahead of you in strategy," said
the traitor, with a complacent smile.</p>

<p>"You beat me in the game we have been playing; but<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
that only makes us even, for I got the better of you in
another affair."</p>

<p>"Not of me; it was the stupidity of Phil Kennedy
that ruined the Snowden business. I pride myself on
my strategy, Somers. I have never been beaten in anything
of this kind yet. The fact of it is, I know whom
to trust. I never give my confidence to a man who
dares to betray it," replied Pillgrim, rubbing his hands
with delight at his own cleverness.</p>

<p>Somers was of the opinion that he would think differently
before many days had elapsed; but he was as
prudent as the circumstances required.</p>

<p>At eight bells, the fourth lieutenant took the deck for
the first watch; and from that time until the following
afternoon, he saw but little of the conspirator. At this
time, the ship was off Cape Fear, though too far out to
sight the land, or even the outer line of blockaders which
kept vigilant watch over the entrance to the river. Precisely
at the moment when one bell struck in the first
dog-watch, the engine of the Chatauqua, without any
order from the officer of the deck, and without any apparent
reason, suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>It had proved itself to be a very good and well-meaning
engine, thus far, and all hands began to wonder what
had happened, or what was going to happen. But Mr.
Cranklin, the chief engineer, presently reported that
there was a "screw loose" somewhere, and that it<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
would be necessary to lay to, and make some repairs.
Certainly it was a very opportune moment for the ship
to stop; and those who did not know what had passed
between the chief engineer and the first lieutenant might
have supposed that the zealous engine, heretofore so faithful
in the discharge of its trying duties, had overheard
some of the conversation we have related, and was waiting
for the Ben Nevis to show herself to seaward.</p>

<p>In further confirmation that the stoppage was not entirely
owing to the obstinacy of the engine, it was
observed that extra lookout men had been stationed on
the fore yard, and on the cross-trees, since meridian of
that day. The captain and the first lieutenant were often
seen in confidential communication; and everybody on
board seemed to be impressed with the idea that something
was about to "turn up."</p>

<p>Something did "turn up," about three bells; for the
man on the fore cross-trees, reported a vessel on the
beam. The dense mass of black smoke in the wake of
her smoke-stack indicated that she was an English
blockade runner, approaching the coast so as to run in
after dark. As soon as this agreeable information
spread through the Chatauqua, it created an intense
excitement, not manifested in noisy demonstrations, for
that would have been in violation of the strict rule of
naval discipline, but in the expectant eyes and stimulated
movements of the officers and crew, to whose<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
pockets, as well as to their national pride, the prospect
of a rich prize appealed with tremendous force.</p>

<p>At this thrilling moment, when everything depended
upon the sailing qualities of the Chatauqua, either Mr.
Cranklin had completed his remedial efforts, or the
engine had come to a realizing sense of the proprieties of
the occasion, and was sensible of the appalling wickedness
of disappointing the two hundred and fifty anxious
souls on board. The docile machine was reported to be in
condition for active service. The bells pealed forth the
signal to "go ahead slowly," then "at full speed," and
the Chatauqua darted away.</p>

<p>"Hard a starboard!" said Mr. Somers, now the
officer of the deck, to the quartermaster, who was conning
the wheel.</p>

<p>"Hard a starboard, sir!"</p>

<p>"Steady!"</p>

<p>"Steady, sir!"</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Somers?" demanded Pillgrim,
in a low, angry tone, as he passed the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. I only obey orders," replied
Somers, as he glanced ahead at the chase.</p>

<p>"Do you know what steamer that is?" asked
Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"How should I?"</p>

<p>"It is the Ben Nevis."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"<span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>"I know; that is sufficient. We must save her,"
said the second lieutenant, in low, but excited tones.</p>

<p>The chase continued for half an hour longer, when it
was evident that the Ben Nevis&mdash;for it was indeed she&mdash;had
changed her course, and was headed to the eastward.</p>

<p>"This will never do, Mr. Somers," said Mr. Hackleford.
"We can't sail with her. We must change our
tactics."</p>

<p>"She gains upon us," replied Somers.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall lose her, sir."</p>

<p>"I would give my year's pay to capture her, Mr.
Somers, if it were only for your sake."</p>

<p>Somers suggested an idea to the first lieutenant, who,
after the approval of Captain Cascabel, adopted it.</p>

<p>"Clear away the first cutter," said Mr. Hackleford.
"Lower away."</p>

<p>The first cutter was soon in the water, the ship having
now stopped her engine.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim, you will stand by in the first cutter
till that steamer comes up. Capture her if her papers
are not all right, or if she is bound into Wilmington."</p>

<p>A smile of satisfaction lighted up the countenance of
the second lieutenant, when he found he was to go in the
boat. The first cutter pulled away.</p>

<p>"Clear away the second cutter!" said the first lieutenant;<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
and while the men were eagerly performing this
duty, the captain instructed Somers, who was to go in
her, in regard to the duty he was expected to perform.</p>

<p>Somers took his place in the stern-sheets of the second
cutter, which was armed with a twenty-four pounder
howitzer, while the first cutter had nothing but small
arms. As soon as this boat left the ship's side, the Chatauqua
came about, as though she had abandoned the
chase, and stood to the westward.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis immediately discovered the change
which had been made in the course of her pursuer. Apparently
satisfied that she had outwitted the man-of-war,
she put about and headed towards the coast again, without
suspecting the fact that two boats lay in her track.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">A CONFLICT OF AUTHORITY.</p>

<p>It was about sunset when the Ben Nevis put
about and headed in shore. The first cutter
was at least half a mile in advance of the
second, and both, of them lying near the track
of the blockade-runner. It was useless to pull towards
the expected prize; on the contrary, it was better policy
to keep still, so as not to attract the attention of her
people.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis, when she changed her course, might
have been about five miles distant from the Chatauqua,
and the longer the meeting between the steamer and the
boats was deferred, the more would the darkness favor
the latter. It was thought that the blockade-runner
would approach at half speed, so as not to encounter the
fleet off the river at too early an hour; but her commander
did not appear to regard this delay as necessary,
and came down at full speed. It was not dark, therefore,
when the first cutter was within hail of her.</p>

<p>As soon as the Ben Nevis discovered the nearest boat,<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
she sheered off, though, as the first cutter had no howitzer,
she could have everything her own way. Somers
kept the second cutter just out of hail of the other boat;
and carefully watched the operations of the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>The steamer sheered off just enough to avoid the boat;
but presently she resumed her course, as if, making
twelve knots, she had nothing to fear from an enemy
with oars only to urge her forward. It would be impossible
for the first cutter to board her at full speed, and
she seemed disposed to run the risk of a shot or two
rather than expose herself to falling into any other trap
which the man-of-war might have set for her.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis dashed on, therefore, in a direction
which placed the first cutter on her starboard bow, when
Mr. Pillgrim hailed her, and ordered her to heave to,
accompanying the command with a peculiar wave of his
cap in the air, which was thrice repeated, very much to
the astonishment, no doubt, of the loyal blue-jackets in
the boat with him.</p>

<p>"Topple my timber-heads! What does all that
mean?" exclaimed Boatswain Longstone, who, by the
especial request of the fourth lieutenant, had a place
in the stern-sheets of the second cutter.</p>

<p>"Wait, and you will see," replied Mr. Somers.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis at once stopped her wheels, and the
first cutter pulled towards her.<span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>"That beats me!" ejaculated the boatswain. "What
did she stop for?"</p>

<p>"Probably her captain thinks that is his best course,"
replied Somers, who knew very well why she had
stopped.</p>

<p>The commander of the blockade-runner evidently recognized
the voice and the signal of Pillgrim, and, like an
obedient servant, was willing to shift the responsibility
of the occasion on his owner and employer. Honest
Tom Longstone was sorely perplexed by the movement
of the steamer and the conduct of the second lieutenant
of the Chatauqua, for a suspicion of foul play on the
part of one of his officers could not have entered his
loyal heart.</p>

<p>The first cutter touched the side of the Ben Nevis, and
Mr. Pillgrim went up the accommodation ladder.</p>

<p>"Clear away the howitzer!" said Somers.</p>

<p>The boatswain looked at him as though he had been
mad.</p>

<p>"Man the howitzer!"</p>

<p>The gun was loaded with a solid shot, and made ready
for instant use.</p>

<p>"Now give way, boatswain," continued Somers; and
the second cutter dashed swiftly over the long billows
towards the Ben Nevis.</p>

<p>"Are you going to use that gun?" asked Tom Longstone,
in a low tone.<span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>"If necessary."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Pillgrim has the steamer. He has boarded
her."</p>

<p>"We will wait and see," answered Somers, evasively;
for it was expected and intended that the second lieutenant
should "hang himself," on this interesting occasion.</p>

<p>Before the second cutter could reach the steamer, Mr.
Pillgrim had completed his examination on board of her,
and descended to his boat. As he gave the order for
the cutter to shove off, Somers's boat shot in alongside
of her.</p>

<p>"She is all right, Mr. Somers," said the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"All right?" exclaimed Somers; and, in spite of himself,
he actually trembled with emotion, being conscious
that a very trying scene was before him&mdash;one which
would require all his skill and all his energy.</p>

<p>"I say she is all right, Mr. Somers," repeated Pillgrim,
sharply, for he did not appear to like the tone and
manner of the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p>"What is she?"</p>

<p>"She is an American steamer from Baltimore, bound
to Havana."</p>

<p>"What is she doing in here, then?" demanded Somers.</p>

<p>"That's her affair. Don't you see the American flag
at her peak?"</p>

<p>"What is her name?"<span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>"The Ben Nevis," replied Pillgrim, with the most
expressive emphasis. "Sheer off, and return to the
ship."</p>

<p>"I think she is a blockade-runner."</p>

<p>"Do you, indeed?" sneered the traitor.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied she is."</p>

<p>"I have boarded her, and my report will be final in
this matter."</p>

<p>"My orders were to board her," said Somers.</p>

<p>"Your orders?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I am your superior officer."</p>

<p>"You are, Mr. Pillgrim."</p>

<p>"Of course your orders were intended to be carried
out, in case you happened to come up with the steamer
before I did."</p>

<p>"I was ordered to board her, Mr. Pillgrim, and I
feel compelled to obey," replied Somers, with firmness,
though he still trembled with emotion.</p>

<p>"Steady, Mr. Somers; be careful," said Tom Longstone,
bewildered by this conflict of authority&mdash;a circumstance
he had not before observed in his long career
in the navy. "He is your superior officer."</p>

<p>"I know what I am about, Tom," whispered Somers,
compassionating the misery his apparently mutinous actions
must cause his honest friend.</p>

<p>"If you do, go ahead, my darling."<span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I order you to return to the ship," said
Mr. Pillgrim, sternly.</p>

<p>"I must obey the captain's orders, and board this
steamer."</p>

<p>"You mistake your orders, and I insist that you obey
me."</p>

<p>"You will excuse me if I disregard your command;
and I will be answerable to the captain for my conduct."</p>

<p>"The captain is not here; I am your superior officer.
Disobey me at your peril!" continued Pillgrim, in savage
tones.</p>

<p>"Is it all right?" shouted the captain of the Ben
Nevis, who was standing on the starboard paddle-box of
the steamer.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; all right. Start your wheels!" replied
Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"Captain, if you move a wheel, I will fire into you!"
added Somers; and the captain of the howitzer stood,
with the lock-string in his hand, ready to execute the
order when it should be given.</p>

<p>The commander of the Ben Nevis looked down upon
the second cutter's gun, pointing into the hull of his
vessel, so that the twenty-four pound shot would pass
through her engine-room. He did not give the order to
start the wheels. Pillgrim was disconcerted: he was
foiled in his scheme. By this time he realized that the<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
fourth lieutenant of the Chatauqua was not the willing,
timid tool he had taken him to be.</p>

<p>The men in both boats were astonished and confounded
by the startling clash of authority between their
officers. Such a thing had never been known before.
They had been surprised when Mr. Pillgrim declared
that the steamer was all right, for there was not one of
them who was not perfectly satisfied that the vessel was
running in to break the blockade. They were still more
surprised when Mr. Somers dared to dispute the conclusions
of his superior officer. Involuntarily they took
sides with the fourth lieutenant, because his opinion that
the Ben Nevis was not all right coincided with their
own, and because the prize-money went with his view
of the matter. But they were well disciplined men, and
each crew, thus far, obeyed the orders of its own officer;
and, so far as they were concerned, there was no conflict
of command, though this was likely soon to be the
case.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I warn you&mdash;beware!" said Pillgrim,
with the most expressive emphasis.</p>

<p>"I intend to do my duty," replied Somers.</p>

<p>"Bully for the fourth luff!" shouted a seaman in the
second cutter, who felt disposed to take a part in the
dispute.</p>

<p>"Silence!" interposed Somers, sternly, as he perceived
that this bad example was likely to be followed by others,<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
and he felt that the occasion was too serious and solemn
to admit of anything like levity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, you know the consequences!" continued
the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Remember!"</p>

<p>"I know what I am about," answered Somers, understanding
to what Pillgrim alluded, though of course it
was incomprehensible to others in the boats. "I shall
board the steamer."</p>

<p>"Do it at your peril!"</p>

<p>"I shall do it."</p>

<p>"This is mutiny!" stormed Pillgrim, with an oath,
as he took a revolver from his belt.</p>

<p>"I will abide the consequences," replied Somers,
drawing his pistol.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Mr. Somers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, boatswain!"</p>

<p>"You will ruin yourself," whispered Tom, whose
bronzed face was ghastly pale, and whose lips quivered
with the anxiety he felt for his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly cool, Tom; don't be alarmed about
me," replied Somers, tenderly, as he glanced at the expression
of suffering on the face of his faithful friend.
"That man is a traitor!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Once more, Mr. Somers, will you obey me, or will
you not?" shouted Mr. Pillgrim, angrily.
<a id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>"If you will capture this steamer, as you should do,
I will obey you in all things," replied Somers. "I
know she is about to run the blockade, and so do you."</p>

<p>"I have examined her, and I declare that her papers
are all right. My decision is final. Return to the ship,
Mr. Somers, and there answer for your mutinous conduct."</p>

<p>"I shall board this vessel," replied Somers, as he
ordered the bowman to haul in towards the steamer.</p>

<p>"This is mutiny, and I shall treat it as such. I <i>will</i>
be obeyed!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim raised his pistol, and fired at the rebellious
officer; but he was too much excited to take good
aim, if, indeed, he intended to do anything more than
intimidate his inferior officer. The ball whistled within
a few feet of Somers's head, and roused his belligerent
spirit. He raised his revolver on the instant, before the
second lieutenant was ready to repeat his experiment,
and fired.</p>

<p>The traitor sank down in the stern-sheets of the cutter.
The men seemed to be paralyzed by this sharp work,
and sat like statues on the thwarts.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A Conflict of Authority. <a href="#Page_148">Page 148</a>.</p><p>"Haul in, bowman!" said Somers, in sharp and
earnest tones, breaking the solemn silence of that awful
moment.</p>

<p>The man obeyed mechanically, and the others did the
same when required to boat their oars; but probably
there was not one of the crew of either cutter who did
<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>not believe that the fourth lieutenant would be hung at
the yard-arm for his mutinous, murderous conduct.</p>

<p>Somers directed the coxswain of the first cutter to
pull in to the accommodation ladder of the steamer.
He was obeyed, and Boatswain Longstone was ordered
to take charge of the boat. Eight men, armed with
cutlasses and revolvers, were sent on board the Ben
Nevis, and Somers followed them. The captain protested
against the capture, but his papers were not what
they were represented to be by Pillgrim. The character
of the steamer was evident, and she was taken possession
of by the fourth lieutenant, and the crews of both
cutters were ordered on board.</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Pillgrim?" asked Somers of the boatswain.
"Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the ball only glanced along the side of his
head. He bleeds badly, but he is not severely wounded."</p>

<p>The second lieutenant was soon able to sit up, and was
assisted on board the Ben Nevis, where he was conducted
to a state-room, and two seamen placed as guards at the
door.</p>

<p>"Somers, you have played me false!" said Pillgrim,
with a savage expression on his pale face, "but you are
a doomed man."</p>

<p>"As you please, Mr. Pillgrim. You will consider
yourself under arrest," replied Somers, as the traitor
passed into his state-room.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE PRIZE STEAMER.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the capture of the Ben
Nevis was completed. Rockets were thrown up
to inform the Chatauqua of her present position,
and with guards of seamen in the engine and fire-rooms,
the wheels of the captured steamer were set in
motion, and she was headed to the north. Somers displayed
his usual decision and energy, and perhaps the
men began to think, by this time, that the young officer
knew his duty and was competent to perform it.</p>

<p>While the Ben Nevis was making her way towards
the Chatauqua, Somers paced the deck, thinking of the
great event which had just transpired. The captain of
the Ben Nevis, sullen and discontented, stood by the
quartermaster at the wheel. He had attempted to enter
the state-room of the wounded officer, but the seamen in
charge of the prisoner had been instructed to exclude
him, and they carefully obeyed their orders.</p>

<p>The men of the first and second cutters were silent and
troubled. Perhaps they fully sympathized with Somers,<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
and dreaded the consequence of the decisive deed he had
performed. However the petty officers and seamen felt,
it is quite certain that Boatswain Longstone could hardly
keep from weeping when he thought of the punishment
which might be in store for his young friend. He was
in charge of the lookouts forward, and when the Chatauqua
was sighted, he went aft to report to Somers.</p>

<p>"Very well; we shall soon see the end of this business,"
said the young officer.</p>

<p>"I would like to see you safe through it," added the
boatswain, in tones of unaffected sympathy.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tom?" asked Somers.</p>

<p>"I feel worse to-night than I have before for twenty
odd years," groaned Tom.</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this is bad business. It's no little thing
to fire a pistol at your superior officer."</p>

<p>"I told you what he was."</p>

<p>"I know you said he was a traitor; but it don't do
for an officer in the navy to take the law into his own
hands."</p>

<p>"This steamer makes sixteen knots an hour, they
say," said Somers, with a smile.</p>

<p>The boatswain looked at him, and wondered what this
had to do with shooting the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"She was going to run the blockade," continued
Somers.<span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>"No doubt of that."</p>

<p>"Then they intended to fit her out as a Confederate
cruiser."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they did, Mr. Somers; you know best."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim did not intend to capture her."</p>

<p>"He did not, sartinly."</p>

<p>"Suppose I had permitted this vessel to go on her
way, to run the blockade, which she could have done as
easily as a hundred others have done the same thing, at
the same place, and then come out as a man-of-war."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Pillgrim was your superior officer, and he
was responsible, not you."</p>

<p>"I carried out my orders to the letter, Tom."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"To the letter, I said."</p>

<p>"Were you ordered to shoot Mr. Pillgrim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if necessary."</p>

<p>"Thank'ee, Mr. Somers. You have taken a weight
heavier than the best bower off my stomach. I'd rather
be where Jonah was&mdash;in the whale's belly&mdash;than see any
harm come to you. I feel better now."</p>

<p>"You shall know all about it, Tom, in a few days, or
perhaps a few hours."</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied, Mr. Somers. Shiver my kevel-heads,
but I ought to have been satisfied with anything you do."</p>

<p>By this time the steamer came up with the Chatauqua,
and both vessels stopped their engines, as the Ben Nevis
rounded to under the stern of the man-of-war.<span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>"Chatauqua, ahoy!" shouted Somers.</p>

<p>"On board the prize!" replied the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"Send the surgeon on board, if you please."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay."</p>

<p>In a few moments the third cutter, in charge of Mr.
Transit, the master, put off from the ship, with Dr. De
Plesion on board.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Pillgrim, sir?" asked the master of
Somers.</p>

<p>"Wounded, below."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hackleford wishes your report forthwith on
board the ship."</p>

<p>"Mr. Transit, Mr. Pillgrim is under arrest. You
will permit no one to communicate with him except the
surgeon."</p>

<p>"Under arrest!" exclaimed Mr. Transit.</p>

<p>"I have no time to explain," replied Somers, as he
directed his coxswain to pipe down his boat's crew.</p>

<p>When the second cutter was hauled up to the accommodation
ladder, Somers stepped on board, and a few
moments later, touched his hat to the first lieutenant on
the quarter deck of the Chatauqua.</p>

<p>"I have to report that I have captured the Ben Nevis,"
said Somers.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Pillgrim?" asked Mr. Hackleford, the
captain standing by, an interested and excited listener.</p>

<p>"He is wounded, and under arrest, sir."<span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>"How wounded?"</p>

<p>"He fired at me, and in self-defence I was obliged to
shoot him. I think he is not seriously wounded. He
boarded the Ben Nevis, and had given the captain of her
permission to proceed, though the vessel was headed towards
Cape Fear."</p>

<p>"You have done well, Mr. Somers," said Captain Cascabel.
"Beat to quarters, Mr. Hackleford."</p>

<p>When the crew were at quarters, Mr. Hackleford explained
to them what had occurred, and fully justified
the course of the fourth lieutenant; whereupon an earnest
and enthusiastic cheer rang through the ship.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied, Tom?" asked Somers of the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Bless ye! I was satisfied before, Mr. Somers.
There is only one dark thing in the whole of it."</p>

<p>"What's that, Tom?"</p>

<p>"If Captain Cascabel and Mr. Hackleford both knew
that Mr. Pillgrim was a traitor, why did they send him
out to capture that steamer? That's what I can't see
through."</p>

<p>"Can't you? Well, if they had not sent him, we
should not have captured the Ben Nevis."</p>

<p>"I don't see why."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Well, you are not as sharp as you are
sometimes."</p>

<p>"I know I'm dull, Mr. Somers, but splinter my figger
head if I can see through it."<span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>"The Ben Nevis is good for fifteen knots at least."</p>

<p>"I know that; she did it while we were coming up."</p>

<p>"The Chatauqua can't make more than twelve."</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, the Chatauqua could not catch the
Ben Nevis."</p>

<p>"That's clear enough. But we were out in the boats,
and were close aboard of her."</p>

<p>"And just then she sheered off. Could the boats have
overhauled her?"</p>

<p>"Sartinly not; but you could have put a shot through
her hull."</p>

<p>"Which might, at that distance, have disabled her,
and might not. The chances were all against us. But
the moment Mr. Pillgrim hailed her, and swung his cap,
she stopped her wheels. They knew very well he would
not detain her."</p>

<p>"I see now."</p>

<p>"Probably the captain of the Ben Nevis knew the
Chatauqua, and knew that Pillgrim was on board of her,
and they were on the lookout for him. If any other officer
than myself had been in the second cutter, I am satisfied
Mr. Pillgrim would not have returned to his boat,
but would have staid on board the Ben Nevis."</p>

<p>"He's a horrible villain&mdash;arn't he?" said the honest
boatswain.</p>

<p>This conversation took place while Captain Cascabel<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
was preparing his despatches to be sent by the prize
steamer to the navy department. When they were completed,
Somers was sent for, and he repaired at once to
the captain's cabin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, though I can hardly spare you, I feel
compelled to send you home as prize master in the Ben
Nevis. I have commended you to the department," said
Captain Cascabel, as he handed him the despatches.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>A prize crew was at once detailed, with two master's
mates to act as first and second officers, and a corporal
and three marines to guard the prisoner who was to be
sent back in the prize. Somers bade a hasty good by to
his brother officers, and with his crew was sent on board
the Ben Nevis, whose deck he was now to tread for a
brief period as her commander. His orders required
him to take the Ben Nevis to Fortress Monroe, and there
communicate with the navy department.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor, how is your patient?" asked Somers,
when he reached the deck of the prize.</p>

<p>"He will do very well. If you had put the bullet
half an inch nearer his brain, you would have finished
him. The skin is torn off the side of his head, and I
suppose the ball stunned him. He is sitting up now,
and appears to be as well as ever, though in no very
amiable frame of mind."</p>

<p>"I suppose not."<span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>"He says you are a rebel and a traitor, and he intends
to prove it. I told him I thought his wound had
affected his brain."</p>

<p>"It would require a long story to explain what he
means. Mr. Hackleford has the papers, and I doubt not
he will tell you all about it, doctor," replied Somers, as
he proceeded to arrange for the return voyage.</p>

<p>All who were not going home in the Ben Nevis were
sent back to the Chatauqua. The firemen and engineers
of the prize steamer were willing to discharge their
duties as before, and under the direction of one of the
second assistants from the ship, they were set at work.
The first and third cutters pulled away towards the man-of-war,
giving three rousing cheers as they departed, and
the Ben Nevis steamed away to the northward.</p>

<p>By this time it was ten o'clock at night. The watch
was set on deck, and Somers went below to obtain his
supper, for he felt the need of some rest and refreshment.
The steward, anxious to be on good terms with the new
commander, had provided the best meal the larder of the
Ben Nevis afforded, and Somers was hungry enough to
do it ample justice.</p>

<p>A marine, with cutlass and revolver, stood at the door
of Pillgrim's state-room. When Somers had finished his
supper, and was about to go on deck, the sentinel informed
him that the prisoner had knocked several times
on his door.<span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>"See what he wants."</p>

<p>The marine opened the door.</p>

<p>"Who is the prize master?" asked Pillgrim.</p>

<p>The sentinel looked at Somers for permission before
he replied.</p>

<p>"Answer him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers," answered the marine.</p>

<p>"Will you present my compliments to Mr. Somers,
and say that I beg the favor of an interview with him?"</p>

<p>Again the sentinel glanced at Somers.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," replied the prize master, as politely
as the request was made.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Somers," said the traitor, as the new commander
of the Ben Nevis stepped forward and showed
himself to the prisoner, "I am happy to see you."</p>

<p>"Are you, indeed?" added Somers, rather amused at
the smooth tones of the traitor.</p>

<p>"I am, I assure you. Might I beg the favor of a few
moments' private conversation with you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; have you any weapons about you?"</p>

<p>"None, whatever."</p>

<p>Somers directed the marine to seat himself at the farther
end of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Somers; you are as kind and generous
as ever."</p>

<p>"Let me say, Mr. Pillgrim, that flattery and threats
are all the same to me."<span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>"Somers, you have me on the hip."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"You have won the game."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"I am in your power."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>Pillgrim appeared to be hopeless and disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Somers, I have, in a bank in Philadelphia, fifty thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"What bank?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me; the confiscation laws are dangerous to
men in my situation."</p>

<p>"No matter; I will inform the proper officers of the
fact, and they can find out what bank."</p>

<p>Pillgrim bit his lip.</p>

<p>"I will give you this money if you will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sir! There is not money enough in the
whole world to bribe me."</p>

<p>"I still have the oath of allegiance&mdash;signed by you,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. Mr. Hackleford has it. You left
it in your state-room."</p>

<p>"Now listen to reason, Somers."</p>

<p>"I shall. Reason counsels me to do my duty."</p>

<p>"Somers, I will be revenged."</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Pillgrim. I see you have nothing
of importance to say to me;" and Somers went on deck
after calling the marine back to his post.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE PRISONER IN THE CABIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim's wound, as such injuries are
regarded in the army and navy, was a mere
scratch; but it might have been very sore,
and might have ached severely. The traitor
did not even mention it in his interview with Somers, for
the sore in his mind was much more serious. His victim
had now become his tyrant; not implacable or vindictive,
but firm and unyielding in the discharge of his
duty.</p>

<p>Somers went on deck, satisfied himself in regard to the
course of the steamer, then visited the engine-room, and
other parts of the vessel, until he had assured himself
that everything was right. It was a fine, clear night,
and when the port watch came on deck, he went below,
and lay down on the broad sofa, which extended across
the after part of the cabin. He was tired enough to
sleep, and he did sleep till the starboard watch was called
in the morning.</p>

<p>He was a prudent and zealous commander, and he<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
hastened on deck at once to make sure that his charge
was still safe. The weather continued fine, and every
man was at his post. He scrutinized the log slate, and
questioned the officer of the deck. Everything had been
correctly done; nothing had happened, and nothing was
likely to happen. There was nothing for him to do but
sleep, and he returned to his couch in the cabin, to complete
his nap.</p>

<p>The sentinel at the door of the prisoner's state-room
was still in position. The guard was relieved every two
hours, and the door was secured on the outside by a padlock,
which had been put on by the armorer after the vessel
was captured. Of course there could be no doubt in
regard to the safety of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Somers went to sleep again, satisfied that he had neglected
no precautions to insure the safety of the vessel
and the prisoner. The movements of the steward in the
cabin awoke him at six o'clock. He had slept away all
his fatigue, and when he looked out through the stern
lights upon a smooth sea, brightened by the morning sun,
all his anxiety left him. It was hardly possible that any
accident could interfere with the safe arrival of the prize
at her destined port.</p>

<p>As he rose from the sofa, the corporal of marines relieved
the sentry at the prisoner's door.</p>

<p>"Marine," said Somers, as the man passed him on
his way out of the cabin.<span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>The sentinel stopped and touched his cap.</p>

<p>"How is the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"I haven't heard anything of him, sir, during my
beat," replied the marine.</p>

<p>"Isn't he up yet?"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear him, sir. He's a heavy sleeper, I
should say, for I don't think he moved while I was on
guard."</p>

<p>As Somers had the key of the padlock in his pocket,
he was satisfied it was all right with the prisoner, and
he went on deck. At seven bells, when his breakfast
was brought down, he directed the steward to give Mr.
Pillgrim his morning meal, handing the key of the state-room
to the corporal.</p>

<p>The door was opened, and the marine entered the little
room. Somers sat down at the table to eat his breakfast.
He was blessed with a good appetite, and some
"'am and heggs," which the steward particularly recommended,
looked very inviting. But he had hardly satisfied
himself that the steward had not overrated the
quality of his viands, before his attention was attracted
by an exclamation from the corporal of marines.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Somers, rising from
the table, and rushing to the state-room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim is not here, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Not here!"</p>

<p>"No, sir."<span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>"He can't be far off."</p>

<p>Somers entered the state-room. Certainly the prisoner
was not there; nor was there any indication of the means
by which he had departed. The partitions between this
and the adjoining state-rooms were undisturbed. The
door had been securely locked, and the key was in the
pocket of the commanding officer. The traitor could not
have crawled through the bull's eye which lighted the
room, for it was not more than nine inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The marines who had been on guard during the night
were summoned. They all told the same story; not a
sound had been heard in the room. Both the master's
mates who had kept the watches on deck were examined,
but they had no information to communicate.</p>

<p>"This is very remarkable," said Somers to his first
officer.</p>

<p>"Very remarkable," replied Mr. Hudson, who seemed
to be even more bewildered than his commander.</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Walmsley?" asked Somers of the
steward.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. I 'aven't seen him since 'e hate
his supper last night."</p>

<p>"See if he is in his state-room, steward."</p>

<p>He was not in his state-room. His bed had not been
occupied; no one had seen him since the Ben Nevis
parted company with the Chatauqua.</p>

<p>"Are there any boats missing, Mr. Hudson?" continued
Somers.<span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>"No, sir; the steamer had two quarter-boats, and a
life-boat forward. They are all in their places."</p>

<p>"Wasn't there a dingy, or a jolly-boat, at the stern?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am sure that no boat is missing."</p>

<p>"Then of course the prisoner must be on board."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that, Mr. Somers. In my opinion he
has concealed himself in the hold, and intends to escape
after we go into port."</p>

<p>"But how could he get into the hold?"</p>

<p>"That is more than I know, sir. He isn't in his
state-room; he wouldn't have jumped overboard forty
miles from land."</p>

<p>"He must be found before we make the capes," said
Somers, who could not help thinking how "cheap" he
should feel if compelled to report the escape of his prisoner
to the department.</p>

<p>He returned to the table and finished his breakfast, as
a matter of necessity now,&mdash;for man must eat,&mdash;rather
than of inclination. The Scotch ham seemed to have
lost its fine flavor, and it was really a pity that he had not
completed his repast before the escape of Pillgrim was
discovered. But Somers was satisfied that the traitor
was still on board, and he was determined to find him,
even if he had to throw the valuable cargo of the Ben
Nevis overboard, in order to effect his purpose.</p>

<p>When Somers had worried down his breakfast, he
went on deck to detail parties to engage in the search.<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
The hatches were taken off, and Mr. Hudson was directed
to examine the hold, while Somers himself, with the marines
and a couple of seamen, went to the cabin for the
purpose of tracing the fugitive from his starting-point.
This appeared to be no easy matter, for as yet there was
not the slightest clew to his means of egress.</p>

<p>Somers opened the door of the state-room, which had
been occupied by the prisoner, and there, to his utter
astonishment and confusion, he saw Pillgrim, sitting on
a stool, and looking as composed as though nothing had
happened. Somers could hardly believe the evidence of
his own eyes.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Somers," said the traitor. "I
am happy to see you. I was just thinking it was about
breakfast time."</p>

<p>"Haven't you had your breakfast yet?" asked Somers,
who deemed it best to talk at random.</p>

<p>"How should I? You lock the door, and confine me
to a very limited sphere of observation. I hope you
don't intend to starve me."</p>

<p>"O, no, by no means. I thought it likely you had
breakfasted while on your travels."</p>

<p>"On my travels?" said the prisoner, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You have been out of your room."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>Pillgrim opened his eyes, and seemed to be astonished.</p>

<p>"Certainly you have. When we opened the door half<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
an hour since, you were not here. Perhaps you will not
object to telling me where you have been."</p>

<p>"I have not been out of my state-room, as you must
be aware."</p>

<p>"But you have," replied Somers, stoutly.</p>

<p>"Am I to infer that you accuse me of lying, Mr.
Somers?" demanded the traitor, with an exhibition of
dignity.</p>

<p>"I accuse you of nothing; I only say you have been
out of your state-room."</p>

<p>"But I say I have not. I am your prisoner: it is
hardly magnanimous to insult me in my present situation."</p>

<p>"Are you ready for your breakfast?" asked Somers,
unwilling to pursue the conversation on that tack.</p>

<p>"A hungry man is always ready for his breakfast.
My misfortunes have not impaired my appetite. I am
ready for my breakfast."</p>

<p>Somers directed the steward to bring the prisoner his
morning meal.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, may I beg the favor of half an hour's
conversation with you, when I have done my breakfast?"
added Pillgrim.</p>

<p>"It is hardly necessary."</p>

<p>"Excuse me; it is absolutely necessary for your comfort
and safety as well as mine."</p>

<p>"Under such a threat, I shall certainly decline," replied
Somers, coldly.<span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>"I intended no threat. Send these people away, and I
will speak."</p>

<p>"You may speak or be silent, as you please."</p>

<p>Somers stationed a marine at the door, and sent the
others away, retiring himself to the farther end of the
cabin. He was sorely puzzled to know how the prisoner
had got out of his state-room, and why he had returned.
He concluded that the opening of the hold had induced
the latter step, but the former was still enveloped in mystery.
He determined to give the prisoner another room,
and make a more careful search in the one he now
occupied.</p>

<p>When Pillgrim had done his breakfast, Somers called
a couple of marines, and ordered them to put the prisoner
in the aftermost room. The hasp and padlock were then
transferred to the occupied room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers," said Pillgrim, as he was about to lock
the door, "I should like to speak with you."</p>

<p>The tone was gentlemanly, and even supplicating, and
Somers entered the room, closing the door behind him;
but he was careful to cock his revolver as he did so, for
the prisoner was a desperate man.</p>

<p>"I am ready to hear you."</p>

<p>"It is well you are."</p>

<p>"If you have any threats to make, I will not remain."</p>

<p>"Let me speak only the truth," said Pillgrim, as he
looked at his watch. "In twenty minutes from now, we
shall all be in kingdom come."<span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>There was a malignant smile on the face of the traitor
as he spoke, and it was plain to Somers that the villain did
not speak without a cause.</p>

<p>"Somers, you have beaten me in the last game we
played. I shall beat in the next one."</p>

<p>"I told you I did not come here to listen to threats."</p>

<p>"You will be a dead man in seventeen minutes, Somers,"
continued Pillgrim, glancing at his watch again.
"I could not deny myself the satisfaction of informing
you of the fact. But, Somers, you will have the pleasure
of knowing that I shall share your fate."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you villain?" demanded Somers,
horrified by the thought suggested by the traitor's
words.</p>

<p>"Gently, my dear fellow. Don't use hard words.
But I am glad to see you are moved. Ah, Somers, I
have you now," said the wretch, in mocking tones.</p>

<p>"Speak!" roared Somers, drawing his pistol.</p>

<p>"Shoot me, Somers. I will thank you if you will.
It is better to be shot dead, than to be blown up, mangled,
and then, after enduring a moment or an hour of
agony, to be drowned. Fire, Somers!"</p>

<p>He restored the revolver to his belt, appalled by the
terrible picture which the villain painted.</p>

<p>"Somers, I did leave my state-room. I was not willing
to acknowledge it before your crew."</p>

<p>"How?"<span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>"I have not time to explain. There are but ten
minutes of life left to you and me. We will not waste
them in what is of so little consequence to either of us.
You know of what the cargo of the Ben Nevis is composed?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;of arms, ammunition, and provisions."</p>

<p>"Correct; the ammunition is stowed in the after part
of the ship&mdash;under us, in fact. Captain Walmsley and
myself have laid a train by which the vessel will be
blown up when four bells strike. It wants five minutes
of the time. Captain Walmsley is in a position where
he can hear the bell," continued Pillgrim with perfect
coolness.</p>

<p>"Marine," said Somers, opening the door.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," responded the man.</p>

<p>"Pass the word for the quartermaster to strike four
bells, instantly," added the young commander. "I am
ready, Mr. Pillgrim."</p>

<p>The traitor looked aghast.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="h3">CAPTAIN WALMSLEY.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim, I am not to be intimidated
by any such stuff," said Somers, when he
had ordered the bells to be struck, which
would produce the explosion.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Captain Walmsley will not think it best to
fire the ammunition at the moment agreed upon; some
discretion on this point was left with him; but I assure
you, on my word and honor, that the train is laid
which will blow up the Ben Nevis," said Pillgrim,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"If you had not mentioned the name of Captain
Walmsley, I might have believed you. As it is, I do not.
Your word and honor do not weigh much with me."</p>

<p>"Don't insult me."</p>

<p>"I simply speak the truth. There! do you hear four
bells?"</p>

<p>"I do; and if you are not blown up in half a minute,
you may thank Captain Walmsley for his moderation."<span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>"He is not villain enough to destroy the lives of forty
men, his own people as well as mine, to gratify your
malice and revenge. I give you <i>my</i> word and honor
that he will do nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>Pillgrim looked hard at him, and seemed to be slightly
disconcerted by the obstinacy of Somers.</p>

<p>"If he will not, I will!" said he, fiercely.</p>

<p>"I purpose to put you in irons, when you have said
all you have to say."</p>

<p>"In irons, Somers!" exclaimed the traitor, springing
to his feet, his face flushed with indignation.</p>

<p>"Since you are open enough to announce your intentions,
it is plainly my duty to defeat them. Acknowledge
that your plot to blow up the vessel is a mere scare, and
I may spare you this indignity."</p>

<p>"You will find that it is a reality."</p>

<p>"Why don't it blow up, then?"</p>

<p>"It will, as soon as Captain Walmsley is ready. The
Ben Nevis shall not again go into a Yankee port as a
prize. Mark my words."</p>

<p>"Captain Somers," called Mr. Hudson.</p>

<p>"What is wanted?"</p>

<p>"The men in the hold report a smell of fire there."</p>

<p>"I will be with you soon," replied Somers, convinced
by this message that there was some foundation for the
threats of the traitor. "Go into the hold, Mr. Hudson,
and find the fire, if there is any."<span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>He was cool, and did not permit the wretch before
him to see a muscle of his face move.</p>

<p>"There is fire there, Somers," said Pillgrim. "I
know just where it is. In a few minutes it will reach
the ammunition boxes."</p>

<p>"Corporal," said Somers, opening the door again.</p>

<p>"Here, sir."</p>

<p>"Put the prisoner in irons, hands and feet," continued
Somers.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, Mr. Somers?" asked Pillgrim,
quivering with emotion.</p>

<p>"I do mean it, and I shall stand by till it is done."</p>

<p>"Will you leave me in the midst of the fire, ironed
hand and foot?"</p>

<p>"I will. You kindled the fire; and if you perish by
it, blame yourself."</p>

<p>Pillgrim attempted to resist the execution of the order,
but the marines were resolute, and he was fully ironed
in spite of his struggles.</p>

<p>"Now lock him in," said Somers.</p>

<p>"One word, Mr. Somers."</p>

<p>"Not another word;" and the young commander hastened
from the state-room, and made his way to the scene
of peril in the hold.</p>

<p>He did not believe that even Pillgrim was stupid
enough to blow up the Ben Nevis for mere revenge; and
Captain Walmsley certainly would do nothing of the<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
kind, for he could have no strong feeling on the subject,
at least not enough to sacrifice the lives of himself and
his crew.</p>

<p>There was a smell of fire in the hold&mdash;the hold filled
with powder, shells, and other combustibles. This fact
tended to confirm the statement of the wretch; yet Somers
was incredulous. When he reached the scene of
danger he found the officers and the men timid about
proceeding far into the hold, for if there was fire, there
must soon be an explosion.</p>

<p>"Follow me, my men!" said he, as he walked aft on
the cargo.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" cheerfully responded the men,&mdash;for
the American seaman will go anywhere an officer will
lead him.</p>

<p>In the after part of the hold there was a dense smoke
and a strong smell of fire.</p>

<p>"Keep back! You are all dead men!" shouted Captain
Walmsley, as Somers advanced and discovered the
speaker seated on a box.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" demanded Somers.</p>

<p>"I am going to blow up the steamer," replied the captain,
who held in his hand a tin pan filled with burning
oakum, chips, and other combustible material.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you do it, then?" said Somers.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Mr. Somers, don't stay here,"
pleaded Mr. Hudson.<span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>"You needn't, if you are afraid," replied he, coolly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, in one instant I can blow the Ben
Nevis all to pieces," said Captain Walmsley, with a
proper exhibition of tragic adjuncts.</p>

<p>"Why don't you do it, then?"</p>

<p>"I am willing to give you one chance to save your
lives."</p>

<p>"You are very considerate. Mr. Pillgrim was going
to blow her up for my special benefit."</p>

<p>"If you think I am not in earnest, you are greatly
mistaken," continued the captain, as he stirred up the
burning substances in the pan.</p>

<p>"I see you are in earnest, and I am waiting for you
to blow her up."</p>

<p>"I will give you ten minutes to save your lives; for I
have sworn this vessel shall never go into port as a
prize. You and your people can take to the boats and
save yourselves."</p>

<p>"Will you blow her up when we are gone?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"I have had quite enough of this, Captain Walmsley,"
said Somers, advancing to the fire king, revolver in
hand. "Now go on deck, or I will blow your brains
out, if you have any."</p>

<p>The captain looked at the revolver, and he might as
well have acknowledged his defeat, for his face proclaimed
it.<span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>"If I should drop this into the cargo, it would blow
up the ship."</p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't. There are nothing but solid shot
and shell under you," replied Somers; and perhaps his
coolness and self-possession were in a great measure due
to his knowledge of this fact, for he had carefully inspected
the cargo immediately after the capture of the
vessel.</p>

<p>Captain Walmsley, with the blazing censer in his hand,
made his way over the boxes, bales, and barrels which
lay above the heavy articles, to the hatchway. The pan
and its contents were thrown overboard, and the men
informed that there was no danger. The captain was
ordered into the cabin, where he was put in double irons,
as his fellow-conspirator had been. He protested, at
first, against this indignity. Then he begged, declaring
that Mr. Pillgrim was the author of the plot by which
it was intended to recapture the steamer. It was fully
believed that Somers and his crew would abandon the
vessel as soon as it was announced that there was fire in
the hold, knowing that her cargo would readily explode.</p>

<p>Captain Walmsley declared that Pillgrim was a fool;
if he had kept still till the fire was discovered, instead
of declaiming over it beforehand, the plan would have
succeeded. Somers doubted it; and when the humiliated
captain was ironed, he was sent into his state-room, and
a sentinel placed at his door. This business was hardly<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
completed before the marine in charge of Pillgrim informed
Somers that his prisoner wished to speak with
him. The request was peremptorily refused.</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Hudson, I think we have fixed those fellows
so that we shall know where to find them when we
want them," said Somers, when the conspirators had
been disposed of.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and if any other man had been in charge
of this vessel, he would have lost her, Captain Somers.
I should have voted for abandoning her as soon as I was
satisfied that she was on fire."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should, if I had not known the powder
and shells were in the fore hold. But I did not believe
the villains had pluck enough to blow themselves up for
the sake of blowing me up. If there had been any real
danger, they would have been the first to run away."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I think you have managed them exceedingly
well."</p>

<p>Somers was perfectly willing he should think so, and
perhaps he thought so himself. At any rate, he was
heartily rejoiced to get out of the scrape so easily, and
fully resolved that the conspirators should have no further
opportunity to exercise their talents at plotting on
board the Ben Nevis.</p>

<p>There was a mystery still unsolved to the young officer,
and with Mr. Hudson he repaired to the state-room
in which Pillgrim had passed the night,&mdash;or ought to<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
have passed it,&mdash;and commenced a further examination.
There was nothing supernatural, or even very remarkable,
in the absence of the prisoner, when the carpet was
pulled up, and a square aperture, now closed by a pine
board, was discovered in the corner of the room. In
the ceiling there was a similar aperture, which had been
filled up to correspond with the deck above. It was evident
that a ventilator, which had been used to convey
fresh air to the after hold, had been removed at some
recent period.</p>

<p>As Captain Walmsley had indicated this state-room for
the use of Pillgrim, it was probable that he had chosen
it on account of this means of egress. Some time in the
night he must have visited the prisoner, entering through
this aperture, and conducted him to the hold below.</p>

<p>In the fine weather and smooth sea the Ben Nevis
nearly made good the claim of the conspirators in regard
to her speed, for all day she logged fifteen knots, and at
three bells in the first dog watch Cape Henry was
sighted, and at ten o'clock in the evening she anchored
off Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>By the first conveyance Mr. Hudson was sent to Washington
with the despatches of Captain Cascabel, and one
from Somers. On the second day the messenger returned,
with orders from the department. The young
officer took the bundle of documents into the cabin, and
proceeded to examine those directed to himself. He was<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
ordered to hand his prisoners over to the commandant of
the fort, to deliver his vessel into the keeping of the senior
naval officer on the station, and to rejoin his ship forthwith,
taking passage in a supply steamer to sail on the
following day. He was highly commended for the skill
and energy with which he had discharged his duty on
board the Ben Nevis, full particulars of which had been
communicated by Mr. Hudson.</p>

<p>Another document contained his commission as master,
the next rank above that of ensign, which had been
solicited by Captain Cascabel. This paper was full of
interest to the recipient of it, and he was obliged to open
the long letters he had written to his mother and to Kate
Portington, in order to add, in a postscript, this important
intelligence. He was proud and happy, and more
than ever satisfied that republics are not ungrateful, notwithstanding
the tradition to the contrary.</p>

<p>At the proper time he proceeded to execute his orders
in regard to the vessel and the prisoners. Pillgrim and
his fellow-conspirator were brought on deck. The former
looked easy and defiant, as usual, and assured his
captor that he should be at liberty in a few days.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Somers.</p>

<p>"You shall yet be cheated of your victim, but I shall
not be cheated of mine," said he, with a malignant smile.</p>

<p>"I bear you no malice, Mr. Pillgrim."</p>

<p>"I do bear you malice; and the heaviest revenge that<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
ever fell on man shall fall on you before the end of this
year."</p>

<p>"Your threats are idle. I have heard too many of
them. Pass into the boat, if you please."</p>

<p>Pillgrim and Walmsley went over the side, and the
boat pulled away. The chivalrous military officer removed
the irons from their legs and arms as soon as he
received them.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis was to be sent to New York to be condemned,
and Somers handed her over to the naval officer,
according to his orders.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="h3">OFF MOBILE BAY.</p>

<p>Somers was now entirely relieved from duty.
He had delivered up the prize and handed the
prisoners over to the proper officers. On the
following day he went on shore to spend a few hours before
the supply steamer sailed. On visiting the fortress,
he received the astonishing intelligence that Mr. Pillgrim
had escaped from the officer having him in charge, even
before he had been placed in the casement appropriated
to his use. Somers had cautioned the lieutenant to whom
he had delivered him, of the danger of removing the
irons, but his advice had not been heeded. The careless
officer was now under arrest for his neglect of duty.</p>

<p>By none was this unfortunate event more deeply regretted
than by him who had been the means of foiling
the schemes of the traitor and handing him over to the
custody of the government. Pillgrim had boasted that
he would soon be at liberty. He was certainly a talented
and a daring fellow; and to handle him safely, it
was necessary to understand him thoroughly. Somers<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
had a suspicion that the officer from whom the wretch
escaped was bribed by his prisoner; but of course there
could be no evidence on this interesting point.</p>

<p>A careful search had been made by the garrison of the
fort, but without success. Pillgrim was dressed in the
full uniform of a naval lieutenant, and in this garb his
ingenuity would enable him to pass the military lines, if
indeed he was not provided with the means of doing so
by the faithless officer in charge of him. The prisoner
had escaped on the preceding day, and there was now
little hope of recapturing him; but Somers gave such
information as he possessed in regard to the fugitive.
Captain Walmsley had been less fortunate, and was still
in durance.</p>

<p>The story of the traitor's escape was a very simple
one. When the boat which had conveyed the prisoners
from the steamer to the shore reached the pier, and they
had landed, Walmsley began to protest against his confinement,
being a British subject. He insisted upon
seeing the commandant of the fortress; and while everybody
was listening to this debate, Pillgrim slipped into
the crowd and disappeared, passing the sentinels, who
had no suspicion that he was a prisoner, without a challenge.
Immediate search was made for him; but he
must have taken to the water, since there was no other
place of concealment which was not examined. A
calker's stage was moored to the shore near the pier, and<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
it was afterwards surmised that he had crawled under
this, securing a position so that his head was out of
water, and remained there till evening.</p>

<p>He was gone, and that was all it was necessary to
know. The officer who had permitted him to escape
would be court-martialed and broken, and that would be
the end of it. At noon, as Somers was about to embark
on the supply steamer, a letter was handed to him, which
had been brought in by a contraband. The negro said
it had been handed to him by "a gemman wid de anchors
on his shoulders," whom he had met on the road
to Williamsburg, nine miles from the fort.</p>

<p>The epistle was from Pillgrim, as Somers would have
known from the writing, without the contraband's description
of the person who had given it to him. He
put it in his pocket, and did not open it till he had taken
possession of his state-room on board the steamer. He
was confident that it contained nothing but threats and
abuse, and he felt but little interest in its contents. The
writer, chagrined at the failure of his plot, was running
over with evil thoughts and malicious purposes. Somers
opened the letter and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Old Point Comfort</span>, July 14.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Somers</span>: You have been promoted. You remind me
of the fable. The goat went down into the well. The
fox sprang upon his horns and leaped out. You are the
fox; you jumped over my head; you went up; you are<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
a master now. I congratulate you. You are the only
man in the world I hate.</p>

<p>The Tallahassee is doing a good business for the
South. She has captured fifty vessels. The Ben Nevis
was her sister. You have her. There are more of the
same family. You believe I am used up. No. I write
this letter to inform you that I am not even singed yet,
say nothing of being burned out. I shall be afloat soon.
The Ben Lomond, twin sister of the Ben Nevis and the
Tallahassee, will be at work in a fortnight. She will
then be called the Tallapoosa. Look out for her.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis was captured; my agents bought her
again. The Ben Lomond is now at&mdash;you wish you
knew where! I shall command her. I could not resist
the temptation to inform you of my plan. I know you
will enjoy my prospects!</p>

<p>You would like to make a little arrangement for the
capture of the Ben Lomond. I wish you might. You
will hear of her on the broad ocean in a few weeks,&mdash;capturing,
burning, bonding Yankee ships. It will please
you to read the papers then! I shall strike for a California
steamer. Her treasure will make good my losses.</p>

<p>I am so anxious to meet you again that I am tempted
to tell you where my ship is. I would like to meet you
on her quarter deck. You are a remarkably enterprising
fellow; perhaps we shall meet. If we do, I should feel
justified in hanging you at the yard-arm. You belong<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
to the South. You accepted a commission in her navy.
You betrayed your trust. I shall <i>endeavor</i> to see you
again.</p>

<p>Give my regards to the officers of the Chatauqua.
Inform them of my present brilliant prospects. Remember
me kindly to Kate Portington. Possibly she may be
a little <i>chilly</i> when you see her again.</p>

<p>If you capture the Ben Lomond, otherwise the Tallapoosa,
it would make you a lieutenant. Do it by all
means.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Pillgrim.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Somers read this singular letter three times before he
could form an opinion whether or not its statements were
mere idle boasts, and whether or not they had a foundation
of truth. Was there any such vessel in existence
as the Ben Lomond? This was the interesting and important
question to him. At this time the Tallahassee
was making fearful ravages among the shipping on the
coast, and the success and impunity with which she carried
on her depredations offered plenty of encouragement
for the rebels to send forth similar vessels, if they could
obtain them.</p>

<p>The Ben Nevis had been named after a mountain in
Scotland; Ben Lomond was the name of another. The
former was a Clyde-built vessel, and it would have been
natural to give these twin names to twin steamers. Pillgrim,
in the character of "Coles," had given him a<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
certain amount of correct information in respect to the
Ben Nevis, though he had deceived him in regard to her
destination. He had obtained this knowledge by accident,
and the Ben Nevis had been captured.</p>

<p>To Somers there appeared to be a strong probability
that the statements contained in the letter were wholly or
partially true. There were only two rebel ports into
which it was possible for the Ben Lomond to have run&mdash;Mobile
and Wilmington. The conspirators had told
him that the Ben Nevis was bound to Mobile when she
was actually going to Wilmington. Pillgrim, in his letter,
declared that he was to command the Tallapoosa.
If there was any plan at all, of course it had been laid
before the Chatauqua sailed from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Why did Pillgrim start for Mobile in the Chatauqua?
Was it not possible that he intended, as second lieutenant
of a national ship, to obtain the means of getting the
Ben Lomond, or Tallapoosa, through the blockading fleet?
Did he not endeavor to involve the fourth lieutenant in
the meshes of the conspiracy for the purpose of obtaining
his assistance in this work? It was plausible. Perhaps
the recreant wretch had left some papers in his state-room
on board the Chatauqua, which would be intelligible
in the light which he could bring to bear upon
them.</p>

<p>Bewildered and astonished by the prospect before him,
as he read the letter again and again, and considered its<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
remarkable statements in connection with his previous
knowledge, Somers spent the whole afternoon in his
state-room, and was only aroused from his meditations
by the supper bell. In the evening he resumed his
study of the case, and tried to reconcile the theory he
had framed with reason and common sense. There was
nothing to conflict with this theory but the fact that Pillgrim
himself had given him the information upon which
it was based. The traitor would not intentionally betray
himself. Perhaps he did not expect his statements would
be credited; or if he did, he had twice before been
equally reckless.</p>

<p>Then Somers attempted to analyze the mental constitution
of Pillgrim. The conspirator seemed to be able to
endure all misfortunes. The loss of the Ben Nevis had
not affected him, and he had endangered, defeated his plan
to recapture her by indulging in idle threats before the
match was applied. He had been more desirous of mortifying,
humiliating, and overwhelming Somers, than of
recovering his lost steamer. With great talents for
scheming and plotting, he had displayed the most amazing
stupidity.</p>

<p>At this point the remark to the letter that Kate Portington
would be <i>chilly</i> when he saw her again, came up
for consideration. Pillgrim certainly had some purpose
in view which was equal to, or greater than, his desire to
serve the South, or even himself, in a pecuniary point of<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
view. He was the friend of the commodore&mdash;had known
the family before the war. Somers could not help believing
that, in spite of his thirty-five years, he was an
aspirant for the hand of Kate, and that the bond he had
signed was for her use rather than his own.</p>

<p>Miss Portington might well be <i>chilly</i>, if she discovered
that Somers had pledged a part of her fortune at the
present stage of proceedings!</p>

<p>Somers was nervous and uneasy until he had reasoned
and coaxed himself into a full belief in the theory which
he had suggested. He could not wait for evidence, if,
indeed, any could be obtained. For the present he was
satisfied, and determined to proceed upon his hypothesis,
just as though every point in the argument had been
fully substantiated.</p>

<p>Our young officer was never idle when it was possible
to work. If any of our readers believe that Somers was
very "smart," very skilful, and very fortunate in his
previous career, we beg to remind them, and to impress
it upon their minds in the most forcible manner, that he
owed more to his industry and perseverance than to the
accidents of natural ability and favorable circumstances
combined. For example, when he captured the Ben
Nevis, instead of gaping idly about the deck, and thinking
what a great man he was, he went into the hold, and
made a careful examination of the steamer's cargo. The
knowledge thus gained had prevented him from abandoning<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
the vessel when she was believed to be on fire, and
thus saved the prize and confounded the conspirators.</p>

<p>Somers was not idle now. He procured "Blunt's
Coast Pilot," and "A Chart of the North Coast of the
Gulf of Mexico, from St. Mark's to Galveston," of the
captain of the steamer, and diligently studied up, and
even committed to memory, the bearings, distances, and
depths of water in Mobile Bay and vicinity. He carefully
trained his mind on these matters so important to a
seaman; and being blessed with a retentive memory, he
hoped and expected to have this knowledge at command
when it should be serviceable. It was hard study&mdash;the
hardest and dryest kind of study; but he stuck to it as
though it had been a bewitching novel.</p>

<p>To assist his design he drew maps and charts of the
coast from memory, and was not satisfied till he could
make a perfect diagram of the coast, shoals, islands, and
bars, mark the prominent objects to be sighted from a
vessel, and lay down the depth of water. He had nothing
else to do on the passage; and as the steamer glided
swiftly over the summer sea, he found it a more agreeable
occupation than smoking, playing cards, and "spinning
yarns," which were the employments of his fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>On the eighth day from Fortress Monroe the supply
steamer reached the blockading fleet off Mobile Bay, and
Somers was warmly welcomed by his brother officers.<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
Of course he had a long story to tell, which was listened
to with interest. The escape of the late second lieutenant
was received with becoming indignation. Somers
was now the third lieutenant of the Chatauqua, and he
moved into the state-room formerly occupied by Mr.
Garboard, who had also advanced one grade in his relative
rank.</p>

<p>"Somers, you are just in time for a big thing," said
Mr. Hackleford. "Our Brave Old Salt is going to take
us up Mobile Bay in a few days."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the Old Salamander has issued his orders."</p>

<p>"God bless him!" ejaculated Somers, fervently, in
much the same spirit that a loyal subject speaks of a
popular monarch.</p>

<p>"Ay, God bless him!" replied the first lieutenant.
"He is the ablest naval commander the world has yet
produced. In my opinion he is the superior of Nelson,
Collingwood, Decatur, Porter, Preble, and Hull. By the
way, Mr. Somers, you were with him on the Mississippi?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I was in the Harrisburg when the fleet
passed Forts Jackson and St. Philip. But I am rather
sorry the attack is to take place so soon."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>Then Somers showed him Pillgrim's letter; but as we
intend to tell only what was done, not what was said, we
will not record the conversation.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">BRAVE OLD SALT.</p>

<p>The most extensive and careful preparations were
in progress for the events which, a few days
later, astonished the world even more than the
splendid achievements of the fleet below New Orleans.
The squadron off the mouth of Mobile Bay had been
actively employed for several days in sending down top-masts,
superfluous spars, and rigging. Chain cables had
been extended over the sides of the ships where the machinery
was exposed to injury from the shot and shell of
the fort. Chains and sand bags were placed on the
decks where plunging shot might disable the engines.
Boats were removed from the starboard to the port sides,
for the fleet was to go in with Fort Morgan on the right,
and close aboard of them.</p>

<p>The preparations were advancing when Somers reported
on board of the Chatauqua, and of course he at
once experienced the inspiration of coming events. If
there was any man in the navy whom he admired and
reverenced, that man was Admiral Farragut. It is true,<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
he was not singular in this respect, for every man in the
fleet was equally devoted to him. The "Old Salamander,"
who seemed never to be happier than when in the
midst of the hottest fire which the engines of modern
warfare could produce, was the idol of both officers and
seamen. He was an honest, just, and humane man, one
who involuntarily won the respect of every person with
whom he came into contact.</p>

<p>We were never more thoroughly impressed by the
honesty, justice, and humanity of a man, than when we
took the hand of this "Brave Old Salt." His expressive
eye, and his gentle, but dignified bearing, spoke more
truly and forcibly of what he was, than the most elaborate
biography which the pen of genius could produce. It
almost passes belief that men can stand up and work and
fight as officers and seamen worked and fought between
Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and at Mobile Bay; but
we can think of no better inspiration than the leadership
of such a man as Admiral Farragut.</p>

<p>He was born in Tennessee&mdash;a southern state; his
home was in Virginia&mdash;a southern state&mdash;at the breaking
out of the rebellion. With all the motives which
actuated Lee and Johnston, Tatnall and Hollins, to induce
him to abandon the old flag under which he had
fought in early youth, and served through all his manhood,
he remained true to his country in the hour of her
severest trial. Neither bribes nor threats could move<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
him, and not for one instant did he falter in his devotion
to the flag he had sworn to sustain against all foes.
Glory, honor, and immortality in the hearts of his countrymen
to the noble Admiral!</p>

<p>As a naval commander, he has no rival in the past or
the present, in this or in any country. He has achieved,
once, twice, thrice, what any board of naval officers that
could have been convened from the boldest and most
skilful naval heroes of the united nations, would have
solemnly pronounced impossible. Chance might have
given him the Lower Mississippi&mdash;it did not; but it
could not have given him that and Mobile Bay, and the
brilliant exploits up the Great River. Chance is capricious;
it never metes out uniform success.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut is not simply a brave and skilful
seaman, for the stroke of genius shines out in all his battle
plans, in all his preparations, and in all his movements,
whether on the silent river, as his majestic ship
leads in the van to the conflict, or under the most deadly
and destructive fire that ever was rained down on a
wooden hull. "Brave Old Salt" in the main rigging of
the Hartford, as she breasted the storm of shot and shell
from Fort Morgan, is a spectacle more sublime than can
be presented in the annals of any other nation. The
position he chose for himself on that momentous occasion,
more truly indicates the key to his marvellous success
than any other fact in connection with the battle. He<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
was not there to expose himself needlessly to deadly
peril; he was there to see and take advantage of the
issues of the battle.</p>

<p>His position was a symbol of the intelligence and
bravery which won the great battle. He saw with his
own eyes&mdash;not with others; while his glorious personal
devotion was a type for every other man, which was
imitated from commodores down to powder-boys. We
read of a general who could not remember where he was
during one of the severest and most destructive fights of
the war. If he had been in a position corresponding to
that of the doughty old admiral, it would have been difficult
for him to forget it. But personal bravery alone
does not win the battle on the sea or the land. The
admiral's victories are due even more to his genius&mdash;to
his persevering industry in the elaboration of preparatory
details.</p>

<p>"Brave Old Salt," as Somers always called him, was
our young officer's beau-ideal of a naval commander.
"Brave" he certainly was, and "Old Salt," to a sailor,
means something more than a long experience at sea.
It conveys to the nautical mind an idea of skill which no
"lubber" can possess. It was bravery, seamanship,
and those peculiar qualities which an "old salt" possesses,
that made him great on the quarter deck, in command
of a squadron.</p>

<p>Somers's admiration for the commander-in-chief of the<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
fleet off Mobile Bay was of no recent origin. Since he
had first known him as "Flag Officer Farragut" at
Ship Island, before the grade of Rear and Vice Admiral
had been created in our navy, he had reverenced him as
a superior man, and looked up to him with an almost
superstitious awe. He could hardly realize that they
were both of the same earthly mould, with the like human
hopes and aspirations. Though, for a young man
of his age, Somers regarded his rank of master as very
high, it did not permit him to abate one jot or tittle of
the distance which lay between him and the admiral.
He did not feel any better entitled to tread the same
deck with the glorious old hero, as a master, than he did
as an ordinary seaman.</p>

<p>Somers returned to active duty as soon as he had
reported to the first lieutenant of the Chatauqua, and he
had the deck in the first dog watch on the day of his
arrival. During the afternoon watch he had had plenty
of time to report the incidents of his cruise in the Ben
Nevis. Mr. Hackleford had immediately communicated
to the captain the facts concerning Pillgrim's letter, and
the recreant lieutenant's papers had been carefully overhauled
in search of anything which would shed a ray of
light upon the statements of the strange letter.</p>

<p>The only document which looked at all hopeful was a
note written in cipher, to which there was no key among
the papers. If the communication had been in Chinese<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
or Chaldaic, there might have been a chance of unravelling
it; as it was, the note was written in arbitrary
characters, which were as cabalistic and unintelligible as
the Egyptian hieroglyphics. Somers was annoyed and
discomfited, for he had confidently reckoned upon finding
some letter which contained a hint to guide him. There
was nothing but this note in cipher.</p>

<p>To add to his chagrin, Mr. Hackleford was utterly
sceptical in regard to Pillgrim's letter&mdash;did not believe
the first word of it&mdash;called it "gas," and declared that
it would be stupid and childish to pay the least attention
to the document. Captain Cascabel fully concurred with
him in this opinion, and both of them laughed at Somers
for bestowing a second thought upon it.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Mr. Somers!" exclaimed the first lieutenant.
"There isn't a single scintillation of truth in the
story. If there were even a glimmering of reality in the
thing, I would look into it."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Pillgrim told me some truth in regard to the
Ben Nevis," argued Somers.</p>

<p>"That is the best reason in the world for believing he
has not done so in this instance," said Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must give up the idea, then."</p>

<p>"You must, indeed. If you don't, I am afraid your reputation
for common sense and good judgment will suffer."</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to take this letter in cipher, and
keep it till to-morrow?" asked Somers.</p>

<p>"Certainly."<span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>Somers took the letter, and put it into his pocket until
he had an opportunity to study its mystic characters.
He was mortified by the rebuff he had received, but his
faith, though somewhat shaken, was not destroyed. He
was officer of the deck from four till six. Just before he
was relieved, he ordered the side to be manned to receive
the captain, who was just returning from a visit to the
flag-ship.</p>

<p>As he touched his cap to Captain Cascabel, he noticed
a smile on his commander's face, which seemed to relate
to him, and he blushed beneath the pleasant, but expressive
glance bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers," said the captain.</p>

<p>The officer of the deck stepped forward, and saluted
the commander again.</p>

<p>"You are invited to dine with Admiral Farragut to-morrow
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I, sir!" exclaimed Somers, completely overwhelmed
by this remarkable declaration.</p>

<p>"Rear Admiral Farragut presents his compliments to
Mr. Somers, and would be happy to see him at dinner
to-morrow, on board the Hartford."</p>

<p>The captain passed on to the companion-way, leading
to his cabin, leaving Somers as bewildered as though he
had been invited to dine with Queen Victoria, Louis Napoleon,
and the Emperor of Russia; indeed, he regarded
it as a much greater honor to dine with "Brave Old<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
Salt," than to put his feet under the mahogany of the
mightiest crowned head of the world. It was evident
that somebody had been talking to the admiral about
him; the captain and the first lieutenant of the Chatauqua
certainly felt kindly enough towards him to do so.</p>

<p>To dine with Admiral Farragut! That was glory
enough for a lifetime; or at least to be deemed worthy
of such a distinction. Our friend Somers was no snob;
he "looked up" to great people, especially to those who
were really great. He pretended to no familiarity with
his superiors, though some of the officers were dying with
envy at the notice taken of him by the captain and first
lieutenant of the ship. He did not assume to be familiar
with men who had won a deathless fame in defending
their country's cause. Perhaps there was not an officer
in the fleet who would so highly appreciate such a compliment
as that of which he was now the happy recipient.</p>

<p>When he was relieved from the deck, and went down
into the ward-room, the news had gone before him,
and the "idlers" there congratulated him upon his
rising fame. But Somers broke away from them as soon
as he could decently do so, and shut himself up in his
state-room. He was actually dizzy at the idea of sitting
down at the table with "Brave Old Salt" in the cabin
of the Hartford; and though he took the cabalistic note
of Mr. Pillgrim from his pocket, at least half an hour was
wasted before he could apply his mind undividedly to the<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
difficult problem before him. Finally, the hope of making
a grand revelation to the admiral on the morrow fired his
zeal to such a pitch that the work looked like play to him.</p>

<p>Somers opened the mysterious document and spread it
out on the desk, at which he seated himself. It looked
dark and hopeless, with its dots and dashes, its horizontals
and perpendiculars, its curves and crosses. We present
the note in full, that our readers may be able to
appreciate the difficulty of the task he had undertaken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="border2" src="images/ill-206.jpg" width="400" height="407" alt="" />
</div><span class="pagenum">[199]</span>

<p>If Somers had been a student of the occult sciences, he
might have been more hopeful. An hour's hard study
brought a gleam of light. He thought the note must be
signed by Langdon. There were seven letters in the
signature. This was his first ray of hope. He then
placed all the letters of the alphabet in a column, and
against each made the character that represented it in
the cipher. Six letters were thus interpreted.</p>

<p>The next step was to place each of the letters thus discovered
over its sign in the note. The second and third
words of the epistle then stood, the eights being for
undiscovered letters, as follows: 88nxlo8ond.</p>

<p>"Ben Lomond!" exclaimed Somers, as he gave a
smart rap on the desk to indicate his joy at the
discovery.</p>

<p>Three more letters were gained, and the oblique cross
was only a mark to divide the words. The three letters
before Ben Lomond must be, t h e. The solution began
to be easy, though it required a long time to reach it.
At midnight, when he was called to take the mid watch,
he had it written out as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author1">
<i>Washington, Twentieth of June.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>The Ben Lomond is at Mobile, fitting out. Mallory
gives you the command. The forts will be attacked by the
first of August. You must get her out before that time.</i></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap"><i>Langdon.</i></span><br />

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BOAT EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>At general quarters, on the following day, Somers
looked somewhat care-worn. It was midnight
when he had worked out the solution of the
cipher, and at this hour he had been called to
take the mid watch. But there was no happier or more
exultant man in the fleet. His conquest over the cabalistic
letter had confirmed his theory. The Ben Lomond
was not a myth, and she was at Mobile. Pillgrim had
expressed a desire to see Somers again, and there was a
fair prospect that he might yet be able to do so.</p>

<p>The important event of this day was the dinner with
"Brave Old Salt." But the letter and the dinner seemed
to be inseparably connected. Somers had given the
translation to the first lieutenant, who, to the chagrin
and mortification of the persevering student, did not
appear to attach much importance to the letter.</p>

<p>"If the Tallapoosa, or Ben Lomond, is in the bay,
we shall soon have her," said Mr. Hackleford, "for we
are going to make the attack on the forts within a few
days."<span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>"The attack may fail, and thus afford an opportunity
for the cruiser to come out," suggested Somers.</p>

<p>"Fail?"</p>

<p>The third lieutenant of the Chatauqua stood abashed
before the look of his superior. He did not believe that
any attack made by Admiral Farragut could fail, but it
was possible for the Confederate steamer to run the
blockade, as hundreds had done before her, especially as
she could steam sixteen knots.</p>

<p>"I don't think the attack will fail, sir; but even a victory
might afford the Ben Lomond a chance to run out."</p>

<p>"I don't think there is much chance; but Captain Cascabel
has your solution of the letter under consideration.
Perhaps the admiral may have something to say about it."</p>

<p>Somers was not satisfied with the reception given to
his revelation. He had already formed a plan for ascertaining
where the Ben Lomond was, but the cool manner
in which his communication was received prevented him
from even mentioning it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the captain's gig came up to the
accommodation ladder, and the commander, attended by
Somers, seated himself in the stern-sheets. Captain
Cascabel was received with due honors on the quarter
deck of the Hartford, where the gallant admiral was
walking at the time.</p>

<p>When his superior had been welcomed with dignified
cordiality, Captain Cascabel introduced Somers. The

admiral bowed, smiled pleasantly, and did not look
patronizingly upon the young officer, as he might have
been pardoned for doing. As he stood there on the quarter
deck of the flag-ship, he was full of genuine dignity
and true manliness&mdash;a noble representative of the American
naval commander. He was of medium stature,
well formed, and of elegant proportions. He seemed to
be made of nerves and muscles, and when he moved
there was an elastic spring to his frame, which impressed
the observer with the idea of energy and vigor. He did
not appear to stand on the deck, but to be poised independently
in the air, resting on the planks beneath him
more because it was the fashion to do so, than because
he had any need of such support.</p>

<p>Somers removed his cap, made his best bow, and
blushed like a summer rose. He was deeply impressed
by the glance of the admiral, and the atmosphere around
him seemed to be full of the man at whom he gazed in
reverent admiration.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I am happy to see you," said the admiral,
in a tone so gentle and affable that it seemed to
remove the "curse" of greatness far from him. "I
have heard of you before, and I doubt not we shall be
able to make you very useful to your country."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Somers, not daring to say
any more, and with the feeling of his childhood, that
"boys ought to be seen, not heard."<span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>The admiral, with this judicious commendation, turned
to Captain Cascabel, and opened conversation with him,
evidently determined not to spoil the young man by
taking too much notice of him. Somers was soon at
home with the officers of the Hartford, and behaved himself
with becoming modesty and discretion. He dined
with the admiral, several other officers of distinction
being present. The conversation at the table, singularly
enough, it may appear to our readers, did not relate to
the war, or even to the navy. These topics appeared to
be carefully excluded, though the reserve on this occasion
was probably accidental.</p>

<p>Somers found sufficient pleasure in looking at and
listening to the admiral, and the other distinguished officers,
though he was not ignored, being kindly encouraged,
by an occasional question, to use his voice. But he was
not forward, and his very nature prevented him from
indulging in any of that impudent familiarity which is so
offensive to elderly men, especially if they occupy high
positions.</p>

<p>After dinner, a matter of business came up, and it
soon appeared that Captain Cascabel had given the admiral
all the particulars relating to the Ben Lomond, including
the letter in cipher, which Somers had interpreted.
The conversation took place in private, with only the
three persons present who were most intimately concerned.
The letter was exhibited, and its solution explained.<span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, what is your plan? I am informed
that you have one," said the admiral.</p>

<p>"I have one, sir, but I hardly hope it will merit your
approbation," replied the third lieutenant of the Chatauqua.</p>

<p>"We will hear it, if you please. By the way, our
picket boats report that a steamer came down the bay
this morning, and moored inside the Middle Ground. It
may be the one mentioned in your letter&mdash;the Tallapoosa."</p>

<p>"Probably it is, sir. She can now only be waiting
the arrival of Lieutenant Pillgrim, who is to command
her."</p>

<p>"We must capture that man. State your plan, Mr.
Somers."</p>

<p>The young officer, with no little trepidation, related
the particulars of the method he had considered for the
capture of the Ben Lomond.</p>

<p>"Very daring and impudent, Mr. Somers," said the
admiral, as he glanced with a meaning smile at Captain
Cascabel.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers's <i>forte</i> is daring and impudence. But
his scheme, besides being based on mere theory, is absolutely
fool-hardy," added the captain, throwing a whole
bucket of cold water on the young officer's prospects.</p>

<p>"I do not wholly agree with you, captain. By the
report of the picket boats, there is certainly a sea-going<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
steamer in the bay. That, in a measure, confirms Mr.
Somers's theory. Now, if the vessel is there, the young
man may bring her out if he has the ability to do so."</p>

<p>"What force do you require, Mr. Somers?"</p>

<p>"The first cutter of the Chatauqua, and twenty-four
men."</p>

<p>"You shall have them, Mr. Somers," said the admiral.
"Instead of the first cutter, I suggest a whale-boat,
which will not be much more than half as heavy."</p>

<p>"That would be better, sir," replied Somers, hardly
able to conceal the joy and exultation he felt at the prospect
of being permitted to carry out his plan.</p>

<p>"Captain, you will permit Mr. Somers to pick his
men, and afford him every facility for the execution of
his purpose."</p>

<p>"I will, with pleasure, sir."</p>

<p>"When do you wish to begin, Mr. Somers?" asked
the admiral.</p>

<p>"To-night, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. The monitors haven't arrived, captain,
and it may be a fortnight before we make the attack on
the forts. The steamer may run out in a fog or storm
before that time, and I think we do well to prevent
another Tuscaloosa from preying on the commerce of the
country."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, sir, if we can."</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers's scheme may possibly succeed, though I<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
do not think his chances of cutting out the steamer
are very encouraging."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, admiral," answered Captain Cascabel,
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, your reputation would be seriously
damaged by the failure of your enterprise. Your officers
would be more unwilling to trust you than they are
now if you should meet with a disaster."</p>

<p>"I could not complain. I do not intend to meet with
any disaster. If I do nothing better, I shall bring my
men back with me."</p>

<p>The admiral laughed, and seemed to be pleased with
this confidence, while Captain Cascabel shook his head.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, the risk is very great. You and your
men may be prisoners in Fort Morgan within twenty-four
hours. A failure would damage, if not ruin you.
Are you still ready to undertake the work?" asked the
admiral.</p>

<p>"I am, sir."</p>

<p>"Remember that everything depends upon yourself.
My best wishes for your success go with you."</p>

<p>Somers needed no better inspiration, and his frame
seemed to jerk and spring like that of Brave Old Salt,
when he realized that he was actually to undertake his
cherished purpose.</p>

<p>The gig pulled back to the Chatauqua, and Somers
immediately commenced his preparations. The cordial<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
indorsement of the admiral was enough to silence all
opposition, and to "put a stopper on the jaw-tackle of
all croakers." He was earnestly seconded by the captain
and his officers. In a short time a light whale-boat was
towed up, and made fast to the boom.</p>

<p>Somers's first duty was to select his crew. He was to
engage in a desperate enterprise, and everything must
depend upon the skill and bravery, as well as the silence
and discretion, of his force. The first person selected
was the boatswain, Tom Longstone, who, being better
acquainted with the qualities of the seamen, was intrusted
with the selection of the boat's crew. Just as
soon as it was discovered that some daring enterprise
was to be undertaken by the third lieutenant, he was
beset by eager applicants for a place in the boat. Acting
ensigns, masters' mates, midshipmen, indeed, all the
officers below Somers in rank, begged to be appointed.</p>

<p>The young commander of the expedition was prudent
and cautious, and he accepted the services of none.
Tom Longstone was the only officer to accompany him.
The boatswain would obey his orders without asking any
questions, or bothering him with any advice.</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Somers, I have picked out the twenty-four
best men in the ship&mdash;men that will work, fight,
and hold their tongues," said Boatswain Longstone,
when he had executed the important trust committed
to him.<span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, boatswain. What do you think of the
weather?"</p>

<p>"It's going to be a nasty night."</p>

<p>"So much the better. Let every man take his pea-jacket;
apply to the armorer for revolvers and cutlasses
for each of them."</p>

<p>"A howitzer, Mr. Somers?"</p>

<p>"No; we must go as light as possible," replied Somers,
as he proceeded to instruct the boatswain in regard
to certain "slings" and other rigging that would be
wanted.</p>

<p>Boatswain Longstone did not ask a single question
about the nature or object of the enterprise; and with
the exception of the admiral, and the captain and first
lieutenant of the Chatauqua, not a man in the fleet besides
Somers knew "what was up." It was necessary to
conduct the enterprise with the utmost caution and secrecy.</p>

<p>The boatswain's predictions in regard to the weather
proved to be entirely correct, for at eight bells, when the
first watch was set, it was dark, foggy, and rainy. Somers
had calculated upon this weather, when he had so
promptly chosen the time for his venture. It was just
the night for a difficult and dangerous enterprise, and the
fog and the darkness were its best friends. While the
boatswain was carrying out the orders given him, Somers
had been engaged at the desk in his state-room, preparing<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
for use certain papers, including his commander's
commission in the Confederate navy, and his letter of
instructions, intended for the Ben Nevis, or Louisiana.
With his knife he scratched, and with his pen he wrote,
until the documents suited his present purpose; and they
were placed in his pocket.</p>

<p>At two bells&mdash;nine o'clock in the evening&mdash;while the
rain poured down in torrents, Somers embarked with his
force, consisting of Tom Longstone and twenty-four as
athletic and resolute fellows as ever pulled an oar or
handled a cutlass. The whale-boat was crowded, though
it was of the largest size, being thirty feet in length.
The oars were carefully muffled, and the seamen were
so disposed that the oarsmen could be relieved without
noise.</p>

<p>Wrapping his overcoat closely around him, Somers
seated himself in the stern-sheets of the whale-boat, with
the boatswain at his side. Though profoundly impressed
by the magnitude and danger of the work in which he
was engaged, he could not help thinking of the changes
which had checkered his lot, since, two years before, he
had sat in the first cutter of the Harrisburg, as an ordinary
seaman. Now he was a master, and in command of
the expedition. Tom Longstone had been with him
then; he was with him now. In low tones, they talked
of that eventful night, and of the changes which had
occurred since that time.<span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>Somers was grateful for his advancement, and thanked
God that he had been enabled to perform his duty so as
to merit the favor of his superiors. And in the depths
of his heart he asked God to bless his present exertions
for the good of his country. He leaned on the Good
Father even in this exciting hour, and his religious faith
was the strength of his arm.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE PICKET BOAT.</p>

<p>Through the deep darkness and the dense fog
the boat made its way. There was not an object
to be seen, on ship or shore, to guide its
course; and in front of Somers there was a patent binnacle,
whose lights were reflected on the compass, but
did not even soften the gloom without, into which he continued
to gaze with the most anxious solicitude. He had
carefully estimated the currents the whale-boat would
encounter, and calculated the force of the wind, so as
to determine her lee-way with the nicest practicable
accuracy.</p>

<p>The young commander of the expedition hoped to
strike a certain point of the land to the eastward of the
fort on Mobile Point, distant five and a half miles from
the ship. Half a mile east or west of the desired point
might involve him in serious if not fatal difficulties, and
everything depended upon the accuracy of his calculations.
His early experience as a boatman at Pinchbrook
Harbor was of incalculable service to him, since nothing<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
can supply the place of actual observation in the making
of such nice estimates as were required for success in the
present instance.</p>

<p>The rain poured down in torrents, and the sea was
rough and uneasy; but Somers, never for an instant
turned aside from the grand object before him by the
discomforts of his situation, watched his compass and
closely observed every motion of the whale-boat. He
was fired with zeal, but he was not excited, for he knew
how much depended upon cool judgment and careful execution
of the details of his work.</p>

<p>"Breakers ahead!" said the bowman, in a low tone;
and the words were passed aft to the officer.</p>

<p>Breakers were to be expected; and of course Somers
was not appalled by the announcement. The boat dashed
on till she reached the broken water; but the surf on the
shore, thrown up by the storm, was absolutely fearful.
A stunning roar broke upon the ears of the young officer
as the frail craft approached the foaming billows that
shattered themselves on the beach.</p>

<p>"That's a heavy surf, Mr. Somers," said Tom Longstone.</p>

<p>"So much the better," replied the officer, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"This whale-boat will not be much better than a cockle-shell
in that surf."</p>

<p>"She will go through it, if she is well handled."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir; of course she will."<span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>"The rebels will not expect a boat to land in such a
surf and on such a night. We shall not be expected,"
replied Somers, in a loud tone, for whispers and soft
speech could not be heard above the roar of the billows.</p>

<p>The commander of the expedition stood up in the
stern-sheets, and attempted to penetrate the gloom and
fog in the direction of the beach; but neither sight nor
sound of the shore could be obtained. To plunge through
that boiling surf upon a rebel battery or an artillery company,
would be a sad conclusion of the night's work; but
even this must be risked, for it was not possible to obtain
a single item of information in regard to the surroundings
on shore.</p>

<p>"Oars!" shouted Somers, when he had completed his
unsatisfactory survey shoreward, and there was not the
slightest danger of his order being heard by an enemy
beyond the thundering roll of the sea. "Hold water!"</p>

<p>The onward progress of the boat was stopped.</p>

<p>"Back the starboard, pull the port oars!" added the
officer, who had now taken the management of the boat
out of the hands of the coxswain. "Oars!" he continued,
when the boat was turned so as to head directly
from the shore.</p>

<p>"Now, my lads, pull steady, and mind the orders
promptly," said the confident young officer. "There's a
heavy surf; but if you pull strong, and mind quick, we
shall be through it in a moment."<span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" responded the blue-jackets.</p>

<p>"Stern, all!" continued Somers, when he had carefully
observed the sweep of the last wave.</p>

<p>The oarsmen backed water, and the boat moved towards
the shore, stern foremost. In a moment she was
lifted up by a great billow and swept furiously towards
the beach.</p>

<p>"Steady!" said Somers, gazing forward over the
heads of the men, watching the approach of the next
foam-crested wave.</p>

<p>The men were entirely cool, and their iron muscles
held the boat under perfect control. A huge roller was
coming in, fiercely, rapidly, at double or triple the speed
of the whale-boat, and the first great peril of the surf
was at hand.</p>

<p>The danger was, as our inexperienced readers may not
understand, that the stern of the boat, suddenly struck
by the swift-flying wave, would be lifted high in air, and
the bow forced under; or that the boat would broach to,
and be rolled over in the sea. In either case the boat
would be swamped, and eventually be stove on the beach.
Somers saw one of these rushing billows coming down
with frightful velocity upon the whale-boat.</p>

<p>"Oars!" cried he; and the men ceased backing
her.</p>

<p>"Give way!" he added, with an energy which was
at once communicated to the muscles of the men; and<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
they pulled steadily, as a well-disciplined crew always
does, but with a firmness and strength which caused the
boat to dart forward towards the savage roller.</p>

<p>She met the billow; her bow rose upon it; she passed
over without being ingulfed by it.</p>

<p>"Oars! Hold water! Stern, all!" continued the
young officer; and again the whale-boat moved towards
the shore.</p>

<p>The man&oelig;uvre described was repeated several times,
until the boat had passed through the surf, and struck
heavily on the sandy beach. The men in the bow
were then ordered to jump into the water; and as the
forward part was thus lightened, the successive rollers
bore the boat farther and farther upon the beach, until
the whole crew were landed. The first step of the expedition
had been safely accomplished.</p>

<p>Somers ordered the men to haul up the boat high and
dry upon the beach. There was not a person to be seen,
or a sound to be heard, which indicated the presence of
an enemy. The young officer had now to prove the correctness
of his calculations, for as yet he knew not upon
what portion of the point he had landed. A careful survey
of the ground was therefore immediately to be made.
It was necessary to have assistance in this; and Somers
selected two first-class firemen, very intelligent men, machinists
and engineers, who were in training for situations
in government ships. They had been brought to<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
work the engine of the Ben Lomond, if, fortunately, she
were captured.</p>

<p>Tom Longstone was left in charge of the boat and
crew, and the two firemen followed the commander of
the expedition, who moved towards the north. When he
had proceeded a short distance, he explained to his companions
his object.</p>

<p>"About an eighth of a mile from the beach," said he,
"there is a creek, which widens into a little bay. I
wish to find this creek; it will lead us into Mobile Bay.
Conant, you will go east, and, Wade, you will go west.
You must be very careful, or you will lose your way.
You will not go more than half a mile, as nearly as you
can judge, in either direction. If you find it, return to
the beach, and take notice of the best way to reach it."</p>

<p>The firemen parted, and Somers moved forward himself.
He did not find the creek in the direction he had
chosen, and returned to the beach, after a search of about
an hour. Wade was there before him; but Conant had
not yet made his appearance, though he did not long
delay the expedition.</p>

<p>"I have found it, sir," said Conant, when he returned.
"It lies in this direction:" he pointed to the north-east.
"It isn't a quarter of a mile distant; but I had some difficulty
in finding a good path."</p>

<p>"Did you see anybody, or anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."<span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>The whale-boat was then turned over; each man took
off his pea-jacket, rolled it up, and put it on his shoulder.
The boat was then lifted up, and placed on the shoulders
of the sailors, the garment acting as a cushion to support
the weight, without injury to the bearers. After a great
many trials and difficulties incident to the darkness of
the night and the character of the ground, the creek was
reached, and the whale-boat launched. Unfortunately,
the water was very shallow, and even the light draught
of the boat was too great for rapid progress, though by
various expedients this obstacle was overcome, and the
expedition reached the mouth of the creek at about half
past twelve o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Somers was entirely dependent upon his memory and
the compass for sailing directions; and the careful study
he had made of the navigation of the bay enabled him
to move with considerable confidence. The creek disembogued
in a nearly landlocked bay, whose comparatively
still waters were passed, and the boat began to be
tossed by the waves of the broad bay.</p>

<p>Heading his craft to the westward, he bade the men
give way with a will. Encouraged by the manner in
which all obstacles had thus far been overcome, they
were ready and willing subjects. After pulling about
three miles, the rougher sea and the depth of water
which the bowman had continually reported, assured
Somers that he must have reached the Middle Ground,<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
where vessels bound out usually came to anchor when
subjected to any delay. The Ben Lomond, if she was in
the bay, could not be far distant; but the fog and darkness
prevented him from seeing a ship's length ahead.</p>

<p>"Can you see anything, Mr. Longstone?" asked the
young commander, who felt that he was now in the
midst of the greatest obstacles to the success of his
mission.</p>

<p>"I can't see anything," replied the boatswain; "but
I think I hear something. There, sir! Two bells just
struck in a vessel dead ahead."</p>

<p>"I see her," said the bowman. "It's a rebel iron-clad!"</p>

<p>"She's an ugly customer. I don't want anything of
her," said Somers, as he ordered the boat to go about,
and headed her to the north-east.</p>

<p>"Boat ahead, sir!" reported the bowman.</p>

<p>"Speak out, man!" said the commander. "I am
not afraid of being seen now. Where away is she?"</p>

<p>"On the port quarter, sir."</p>

<p>"Starboard, coxswain," continued Somers.</p>

<p>In a few moments the dark outline of the boat was
seen in the water, and the coxswain was directed to
steer towards her. Somers was fully committed now,
and intended to carry himself through by impudence and
audacity. He was in the midst of the rebel fleet to be
used for the defence of the bay. He knew that the<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
waters around him were patrolled by picket boats, and
he doubted not the craft before him was one of them.
He could not find the Ben Lomond readily, and probably
the officer of this boat would know her position.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"In the boat!" was the reply.</p>

<p>"Oars! Hold water!"</p>

<p>"What boat is that?" demanded the officer of the
rebel party.</p>

<p>"My boat," replied Somers, rather irregularly.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"John Pillgrim, commander in the Confederate navy,
appointed to the steamer Tallapoosa."</p>

<p>"Ah," responded the officer. "You were expected
before."</p>

<p>"Couldn't come before," replied Somers, with perfect
assurance. "Where is the Tallapoosa? I have been
beating about here in the fog these two hours, trying to
find her."</p>

<p>"She lies about half a mile to the northward and eastward."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I shall find her. Please report me to
Admiral Buchanan, and say I shall run out immediately."</p>

<p>"It's a good night for it. I beg your pardon, Captain
Pillgrim; have you a pass?"<span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>"A what?" demanded Somers, as if astonished at the
request.</p>

<p>"A pass."</p>

<p>"No; where should I get a pass, or what should I
want one for?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but my orders are very strict. I cannot
let a boat or vessel pass me without the proper papers."</p>

<p>"What papers do you want?"</p>

<p>"Simply a pass."</p>

<p>"I have no pass."</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged to detain you, then."</p>

<p>"No, you won't!" answered Somers, indignantly.
"Here it is one o'clock in the morning. I ought to have
been over the bar by this time."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, Captain Pillgrim; my orders are imperative,"
pleaded the picket officer.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't help it, I can. I may not have
such another night as this for a month."</p>

<p>"I shall not detain you half an hour. The Tallapoosa
has steam up, and is only waiting for her commander and
the balance of her crew."</p>

<p>"How many men has she on board?" asked Somers,
somewhat startled.</p>

<p>"About forty, besides the firemen."</p>

<p>"I have the balance. It is all right."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, if I persist. I must see your papers."<span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>"I have no pass; but I will show you my commission
and my orders from the secretary of the navy."</p>

<p>"Those will answer."</p>

<p>The boat was laid alongside, and by the light of a
lantern the officer glanced at Somers's commission and
orders. He pronounced them all right, and the expedition
was permitted to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BEN LOMOND.</p>

<p>"That's a bold step, Mr. Somers," said Tom
Longstone, as the whale-boat dashed on towards
the intended prize.</p>

<p>"If it were less bold, it would be more dangerous,"
replied Somers, easily; for he entered so fully into the
spirit of the affair, that he felt quite at home, and was
hardly disturbed by a doubt of final success.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Pillgrim now?" asked the boatswain.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea; but I think he cannot be
far off."</p>

<p>"You left him at Fortress Monroe?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he had started for the South then, to take command,
I suppose, of this vessel. The traitor's plan was to
come down on the Chatauqua, and then bring out this
vessel perhaps, on the pretence of capturing her. At any
rate, he was going to use his official position in the navy
to help him get the Tallapoosa out of the bay, and past
the blockading squadron. If not, he would not have gone
in her, and thus wasted so much of his valuable time. I
wish I knew where he is now."<span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it don't make much difference."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it will make considerable difference.
Suppose the traitor has been on board the Ben Lomond?"</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The Tallapoosa; they have changed her name.
Keep a sharp lookout forward for the ship, bowman."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir! I can't see a thing yet."</p>

<p>"Suppose he has been on board, Mr. Somers?" continued
the boatswain.</p>

<p>"If he has, we may have to fight for the vessel."</p>

<p>"Well, we can do that," replied Tom, as he involuntarily
grasped his cutlass.</p>

<p>"He has forty men aboard of her now, besides the
firemen and coal-heavers."</p>

<p>"Our boys wouldn't mind forty of them."</p>

<p>"I should not hesitate to attack her, but the noise
would wake up the rebel iron clads and gunboats. We
must get the vessel without fighting. I don't believe Pillgrim
has been on board of her. If he had, that picket
officer would have known that I am not the man. I'm
not going to croak about the business, though. In my
opinion it will be all right."</p>

<p>"Of course the Tallapoosa is in charge of some one."</p>

<p>"All her officers are on board, except the commander,
we were told."</p>

<p>"Some of them may know Mr. Pillgrim," suggested<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
the boatswain, who had more fears for his young commander
than the latter had for himself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim has been in the North, and in England
since the war began. I am of the opinion that those on
board do not know him."</p>

<p>"Suppose they do?"</p>

<p>"I shall put them under arrest if they refuse to obey
my orders."</p>

<p>"You are smart, Mr. Somers," said Tom, who
chuckled over the adroitness of his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, even while
he trembled for his safety and success.</p>

<p>"Steamer ahead, sir!" reported the bowman.</p>

<p>"Where does she lie?"</p>

<p>"On the starboard bow, sir!"</p>

<p>"Port a little," said Somers. "Now, my men, you
will obey orders and keep silent. Answer no questions
which may be put to you."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," responded the crew, cheerfully; for
though they seemed to be knocking at the door of a
rebel prison, they had full confidence in their gallant
young leader.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of them "had their doubts," for four
and twenty men are hardly ever gathered together,
among whom there are not more or less who are disposed
to grumble, and croak, and imagine possible disasters.
Within the rebel lines, surrounded by Confederate
vessels, and on the point of confronting superior numbers,<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
it would not have been surprising if these men had been
rather uncertain of the future. Whatever doubts or
fears they had, they believed in Somers.</p>

<p>"My lads," continued the commander of the expedition,
in a low tone, "you are rebel sailors for an hour
or so. You will talk and act as such. Do you understand
me?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p>"You will call me Captain Pillgrim."</p>

<p>The men had listened to the conversation between their
officer and the pickets, and they comprehended enough
of the plan to enable them to act intelligently.</p>

<p>"Tom," said Somers, "there is nothing to prevent me
from acting just as Mr. Pillgrim would do, if he were
in my place."</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"I could go to sea in this steamer, and plunder all the
vessels I could overhaul."</p>

<p>"So you could," replied the boatswain, who seemed
to be amazed even at such a suggestion.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I am not carrying out the very
plan which the traitor had in his mind. Perhaps he
intended to do just what I have done, when he reached
the blockading station."</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Then I shall be Mr. Pillgrim, and carry out his purpose
to the letter; only, when we get out of the bay I
shall do rather differently from what he intended."<span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" shouted a man at the gangway of the
Ben Lomond.</p>

<p>"On board the Tallapoosa!" replied Somers.</p>

<p>"Keep off," said the man, who seemed to be the officer
of the deck. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Commander John Pillgrim, Confederate States navy,
and captain of this ship."</p>

<p>"Man the side, you lubbers!" added the boatswain,
rather improving on the suggestion of Somers, given him
at this moment.</p>

<p>"Captain Pillgrim?" said the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"I said so. Is the ship ready to sail?"</p>

<p>"She is, sir; we have kept steam up all day, waiting
for you."</p>

<p>"Good! You are the right officers for me. I commend
you," replied Somers, as he mounted the accommodation
ladder.</p>

<p>The pretended commander went up the side, closely
followed by Longstone and a dozen of the sailors, and
stepped down upon the deck.</p>

<p>"I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance, I believe,"
added Somers, confronting the officer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swayne, second lieutenant, sir," replied the officer.
"Mr. Langdon is below, sir. I will send for him."</p>

<p>Langdon! It was all up with Somers! Langdon
knew him, had dined with him, had been intimate with
him, and of course it would be useless to attempt to pass
himself off as Mr. Pillgrim.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>"Stop, sir!" said Somers, sternly, and with great
presence of mind. "When did Mr. Langdon come on
board?"</p>

<p>"Nearly a week ago, sir, when the rest of us did."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" added Somers, savagely. "Mr. Langdon
and myself have a little account to settle. He has disobeyed
my orders, and I never will go to sea with such a
man as executive officer. Mr. Swayne, for the present
you will act as first lieutenant. I shall put Mr. Langdon
under arrest at once."</p>

<p>"Here he comes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Longstone, you will arrest the first lieutenant at
once; put him in irons if he resists," said Somers, as he
saw Langdon come up the companion-way.</p>

<p>The stalwart boatswain confronted the astonished officer,
as he approached the spot where Somers stood with
the second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"By order of Captain Pillgrim, you are placed under
arrest," said Tom, as, with a couple of seamen, he placed
himself in front of the executive officer.</p>

<p>"Under arrest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"For disobedience of orders."</p>

<p>"By whose command?" demanded the bewildered
Langdon.</p>

<p>"Captain Pillgrim's, sir?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"<span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but the captain told me to
lose no time. He is going to sea at once."</p>

<p>"Is Captain Pillgrim on board?"</p>

<p>"Of course he is. I just came off with him. He
ordered me to arrest you."</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Blarney, sir!" exclaimed the boatswain, impatiently;
"I can't stop&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Blarney, will you do me the favor to ask Captain
Pillgrim for a moment's conversation with me.
There must be some mistake, Mr. Blarney."</p>

<p>"Can't stop, sir," answered Tom, who could not even
pause long enough to laugh at the rebel's blunder. "My
orders are to put you in irons if you resist. What do
you say, Mr. Langdon?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do not resist; but there is some
mistake."</p>

<p>"No mistake, upon my honor. You may take my
word for it, the business is all straight."</p>

<p>"With what am I charged?"</p>

<p>"With disobedience of orders; and, Mr. Langdon,
you'll excuse me, but there's a suspicion that you mean
to go over to the Yankees."</p>

<p>"I! To the Yankees!"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir; but I can't stop to blarney any
longer. My duty is plain; and I'll bet a month's pay
you will see the captain sooner than you want to. Down
below if you please, sir, to your state-room."<span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>Langdon obeyed in dogged silence. No doubt he
much wondered who the rough fellow was that subjected
him to this summary treatment. But the salutary hint
about irons seemed to satisfy him, and when he had gone
into his room, the door was closed, and a seaman placed
before it. Longstone returned to the deck, touched his
cap politely to Somers, and reported his orders executed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swayne, you will call all hands," said the new
commander of the Tallapoosa, when his dangerous first
lieutenant had been secured.</p>

<p>The boatswain of the steamer piped all hands, among
whom the seamen from the Chatauqua mingled, and
made themselves entirely at home.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swayne, will you do me the favor to read my
commission to the crew," said Somers, handing him the
document which he had carefully "tinkered" to suit the
present occasion.</p>

<p>Tom Longstone held the lantern, and the acting first
lieutenant promptly complied with the request of the
assumed commander. The document proclaimed that
John Pillgrim was duly invested with authority as a commander
in the Confederate navy, and was duly signed
by "S. R. Mallory," though whether that distinguished
rebel functionary had actually issued the paper or not,
Somers was himself as ignorant as the others who listened
to the reading.</p>

<p>From his orders Somers then read enough to satisfy<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
any who might be in doubt of his appointment to the
Tallapoosa, which name he had substituted for that of
Ben Nevis, as it read on the original document, given
him by Langdon, <i>alias</i> Lieutenant Wynkoop.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied, Mr. Swayne?" asked the commander,
when he had finished the document.</p>

<p>"Entirely so, Captain Pillgrim," replied the first
lieutenant.</p>

<p>If he had not been satisfied, probably he would have
been put under arrest as summarily as his superior had
been a few moments before. With such an energetic
captain, it was lucky for him he was satisfied! Perhaps
Mr. Swayne was duly and properly impressed by the
decided character of his commander, and deemed it prudent
to raise no objections.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied, gentlemen?" asked Somers, turning
to the little group of officers.</p>

<p>Fortunately for them, and perhaps for Somers too,
they were also satisfied.</p>

<p>"My lads," continued the courteous but decisive captain,
"you have listened to my commission, and you
have listened to my orders."</p>

<p>Somers paused, and the two first-class firemen from
the Chatauqua started a demonstration of applause
which was a complete success.</p>

<p>"My lads, I am going out to take a look at the Yankee
fleet, to-night," he proceeded.</p>

<p>Applause.<span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>"I am a fighting man."</p>

<p>More applause.</p>

<p>"That Yankee fleet will not stop me!" added Somers,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"That's so!" shouted one of the first-class firemen,
who had a high appreciation of a good joke; and his
remark was followed by a storm of applause.</p>

<p>"I repeat, my lads, the Yankee fleet will not stop me.
I shall pay my respects to the Yankee admiral down
there before the sun rises."</p>

<p>Tumultuous applause.</p>

<p>"Now, my lads, I mean just what I say, and I say
just what I mean. I command this ship, and every man
on board obeys me. I am going through the Yankee
fleet; will you go with me?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" roared the crew; and the voices of the
Chatauqua's people were prominent in the reply.</p>

<p>"Will you go where I lead you?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p>"Very likely I shall send you upon the deck of the
heaviest man-of-war in the Yankee squadron; but I will
go with you."</p>

<p>"Bully for the captain!" shouted the enthusiastic
first-class fireman, which remark was indorsed and approved
by the crew in general.</p>

<p>"What an awful fellow he is!&mdash;a regular fire-eater,"
whispered Mr. Swayne to Tom Longstone.<span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>"He will do all he says he will," replied the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Will he board a Yankee frigate?"</p>

<p>"It's like him; but he is as prudent as he is brave."</p>

<p>"Now, my lads, to your duty. We shall get under
way at once, and I want every man to be true to God
and his country," continued Somers.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the captain!" shouted the fireman;
and they were given with a will, as Somers walked aft.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="h3">RUNNING THE BLOCKADE.</p>

<p>"Mr. Swayne, you will get the ship under
way at once," said Somers, as he turned
from the crew, and walked aft.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant gave his orders, and
the crew were soon walking round the capstan. The
officers of the Tallapoosa had certainly used their time
to advantage, for the crew was well disciplined, though
the twenty-four petty officers and seamen from the Chatauqua
were the spice of every movement.</p>

<p>"Where is the pilot, Mr. Swayne?" asked Somers.</p>

<p>"We have one on board, sir. He berths in the steerage.
Shall I send for him, Captain Pillgrim?"</p>

<p>"If you please, do so."</p>

<p>A master's mate was ordered to find the pilot.</p>

<p>"Is he up to his business?" continued Somers, to
whom the pilotage of the vessel was of the last importance.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he is the best pilot in these waters. He has
taken out a great many vessels on worse nights than this."<span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>"I could take the vessel out myself, so far as that is
concerned," said Somers, nervously. "Does he know
how to get through the obstructions?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, sir; he is perfectly familiar with everything
about the bay."</p>

<p>"And the channel is full of those infernal torpedoes."</p>

<p>"It is, sir; but the pilot knows exactly where every
one of them is located. We are in no danger from
them; but they will blow the Yankee fleet sky high when
they attempt to come up, as they probably will in a short
time."</p>

<p>"So I understand."</p>

<p>"There will be fun here in a few days," added Mr.
Swayne, rubbing his hands with delight, as he contemplated
the destruction of the naval force gathered on the
other side of the bar for the demonstration.</p>

<p>"The admiral down there is no joker," suggested
Somers. "He won't feel his way, and then back out."</p>

<p>"It would be better for him if he did. Admiral Buchanan
is his equal in every respect. With his ram he
will stave in every wooden ship in the fleet. His monitors
will be blown up on the torpedoes."</p>

<p>"I hope the affair will come out right," said Somers,
rather indefinitely.</p>

<p>"It will; you may depend upon it, captain. Whoever
is here when the thing is done will see the greatest
smash-up that has happened since the war began."<span class="pagenum">[235]</span></p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Somers. "But suppose Admiral
Farragut should run by the forts."</p>

<p>"He can't do it; the thing is utterly impossible. The
torpedoes will sink his monitors&mdash;they are like lead,
and if you shake them up a little, they will plump down
on the bottom like a solid shot. His wooden vessels,
even if he gets by the fort,&mdash;which can't be done,&mdash;would
be all chawed up in half an hour by the ram
Tennessee."</p>

<p>"Anchor apeak, sir!" shouted Boatswain Longstone,
who was doing duty as second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Captain Column, the pilot, sir," said the first lieutenant,
presenting a person who had been waiting a
moment at his side.</p>

<p>"I am happy to see you, Captain Column;" and
Somers took his hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the pilot, who was evidently
astonished at the degree of intimacy with which the
commander condescended to treat him.</p>

<p>Already the new captain had won a hard reputation
abaft the mainmast. His stern and decisive measures
with Langdon had been privately discussed among the
officers, and it was the unanimous opinion that they had
"caught a Tartar."</p>

<p>"Well, Captain Column, have you got your weather
eye open? This is a dark and foggy night."</p>

<p>"Wide open, sir," replied the pilot, cheerfully; for<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
Somers's cordial greeting had already produced a good
effect upon him. "The darker and foggier the better,
captain, for such a job as this. But there are so many
Yankee ships outside, you can hardly get clear of them
without a shot or two."</p>

<p>"O, I don't mind that, if you can get us well over
the torpedoes, and through the obstructions."</p>

<p>"The obstructions are not of much account, and as
for the torpedoes, I could put my hand on every one of
them with my eyes shut."</p>

<p>"Good; but I don't want you to put your hand or my
ship on them."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, captain," laughed the pilot. "I know
how to keep clear of them."</p>

<p>"That will suit me better. The ship is in your hands,
Captain Column."</p>

<p>A quartermaster from the Chatauqua was placed at
the wheel, and when the anchor was heaved up, the Tallapoosa
started on her course. Her wheels began to turn
very slowly at first, and before she had gathered any
headway, a boat touched at her side.</p>

<p>"Boat alongside, Captain Pillgrim," reported Mr.
Swayne.</p>

<p>"What boat?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"I have no more time to waste; keep the ship
moving."<span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>As the Tallapoosa gathered headway, a gentleman,
clothed in naval uniform, stepped on the rail from the
accommodation ladder. When he had reached this
point, he stopped and looked down at the boat.</p>

<p>"Stop the steamer!" shouted he, in tones of authority;
and to those who had heard it before there was no
mistaking that voice.</p>

<p>It was Pillgrim, without a doubt! Somers was vexed
and disappointed at this accident, which threatened to
overthrow all his plans; but he promptly decided to treat
him as he had Langdon.</p>

<p>"See what he wants," said the commander to Swayne,
"but don't let the ship be delayed a single instant."</p>

<p>"Stop the steamer!" shouted Pillgrim, with a volley
of oaths, because his first order had not been heeded.
"Stop the steamer, or you will swamp my gig!"</p>

<p>"Your business, sir, if you please," said Swayne,
stepping up to him.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear what I say?" replied Pillgrim, angrily.
"Stop the steamer."</p>

<p>"It can't be done, sir."</p>

<p>"Can't be done!" gasped the traitor. "It can and
shall be done."</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir, that step upon this deck in that
overbearing manner?" demanded the first lieutenant,
roused by the tones and the manner of the new comer.</p>

<p>"I'll let you know who I am. Where is Langdon?"<span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>"None of your business where he is," said Swayne,
spunkily. "What do you want here?"</p>

<p>"You shall soon know what I want here!"</p>

<p>Pillgrim was boiling over with passion at the rough
reception given him by his officers on board his own ship.
He was disposed to be even more stern and severe in his
discipline than Somers had been.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Swayne.</p>

<p>"None of your business who I am, if you don't know;
but I will soon bring you to your senses," roared Pillgrim,
as he leaped down upon the deck, and with the
step of a conqueror moved aft towards the wheel.</p>

<p>"Halt, sir!" said Mr. Swayne, placing himself in
front of the stranger; for he was roused to a high pitch
of anger and excitement by the unwarrantable conduct
of the interloper. "You can go no farther on this deck,
sir, till you explain who and what you are."</p>

<p>Somers stood where he could see without being seen;
for his presence on the deck of the Ben Lomond would
have explained to Pillgrim the reason for his uncourteous
reception. He quietly sent the two firemen and a couple
of seamen to the assistance of Mr. Swayne.</p>

<p>"I am the captain of this ship," replied Pillgrim, who
found it necessary to make this statement.</p>

<p>"The man is crazy," muttered Swayne.</p>

<p>"You understand me now," growled Pillgrim. "Stop
the ship!"<span class="pagenum">[239]</span></p>

<p>"I think not, sir," replied Swayne, coolly; and he
evidently regarded the claim of the stranger in the light
of a joke, or as the whim of a maniac.</p>

<p>"You think not!" gasped Pillgrim, roused almost to
madness by this cool disregard of his authority. "I'll
have you in irons in three minutes, you scoundrel."</p>

<p>"There, sir, I have heard enough of this!" said
Swayne. "No man uses such language as that to me
with impunity."</p>

<p>"I tell you I am the commander of this steamer,"
added Pillgrim, who doubtless felt that the epithet he had
used was unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you are. If your boat is alongside,
you will go into it, in double quick time."</p>

<p>Pillgrim began to storm again, shouted to the pilot to
stop the steamer, and behaved in the most violent manner.
Mr. Swayne's patience was totally exhausted, and
he ordered the seamen who stood near him to arrest the
interloper. A sharp struggle ensued, in which Pillgrim
was overpowered, and was held fast by the stout tars of
the Chatauqua.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant then explained to the captain what
had passed, and what he had done.</p>

<p>"Put him in irons!" said Somers, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Who is he, captain?"</p>

<p>"It matters not who he is. No man can behave in
that manner on board of this ship."<span class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<p>Swayne executed his orders to the letter, and the traitor,
in spite of his struggles, in spite of his explanations
and appeals, was put in irons on the quarter deck of his
own ship. He was carried below, and put in a state-room,
which was guarded by Conant, who had orders to
shoot him if he did not keep quiet.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Ben Lomond,&mdash;for Somers, in
strict accordance with the subsequent "ruling" of Mr.
Seward, refused to recognize the vessel by any other
than her original name, calling her the Tallapoosa only
in the presence of the rebels,&mdash;the Ben Lomond, under
the skilful guidance of the pilot, was slowly making her
way out of the bay. A quartermaster had been stationed
in the fore-chains when the steamer got under
way, to take the soundings, which seemed to be the
pilot's principal reliance in the difficult duty he had
undertaken. Captain Column had placed himself on the
port rail, just abaft the foremast, and the steering directions
were sent aft through a line of officers to the
helmsman.</p>

<p>"By the deep four," sang the quartermaster in the
chains.</p>

<p>"Steady!" said the pilot. "Keep her sou'-west by
west, half west."</p>

<p>"Steady!" responded the quartermaster at the wheel.
"Sou'-west by west, half west."</p>

<p>"By the mark five!" said the leadsman, a little later.<span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>"We are getting into deep water," said Somers.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we shall deepen till we get seven fathoms."</p>

<p>"And a half five!" came from the chains. "By the
deep six."</p>

<p>The pilot went on the bridge, and taking the cord
attached to the whistle of the engine, made a signal,
consisting of several blasts, with irregular intervals between
them. A heavy bell on shore sounded several
times in answer to the signal.</p>

<p>"All right," said the pilot. "I know exactly where
I am."</p>

<p>"By the deep six!" called the leadsman.</p>

<p>The pilot repeated the signal with the whistle, which
was answered from the shore by the bell.</p>

<p>"Quarter less seven!"</p>

<p>"It is all going right, captain," said the pilot to Somers,
who stood on the bridge with him.</p>

<p>"By the mark seven!"</p>

<p>"Hard a port!" shouted the pilot, as he gazed into
the binnacle on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Hard a port!" repeated the line of officers, till the
order was returned by the wheelman.</p>

<p>"Steady!" said the pilot.</p>

<p>"Mark under water seven!" cried the quartermaster
in the chains.</p>

<p>"Keep her south by west," added the pilot.</p>

<p>"South by west!" returned the wheelman.<span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>"This course will bring us into the midst of the Yankee
fleet in about twenty minutes," said Captain Column.</p>

<p>"I'm not at all afraid of the Yankee fleet," replied
Somers.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of anything else," laughed the pilot.</p>

<p>"Where are the torpedoes?"</p>

<p>"Between us and Fort Morgan, which is only about a
third of a mile distant, on our beam."</p>

<p>"And the obstructions?"</p>

<p>"We have passed them; they are of no account.
Captain, I think all your troubles are yet to come," said
the pilot, as he glanced ahead.</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"If we should happen to plump into one of those
monitors, a fifteen inch shot would finish this craft in less
time than it would take to read a man's epitaph."</p>

<p>"I have prepared for all such accidents. The Yankees
will not fire on me."</p>

<p>"No?" exclaimed the pilot, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I think you don't know me."</p>

<p>"I heard the first lieutenant say you were coming
down here in one of the Yankee ships."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Did you, though?"</p>

<p>"We will come to anchor, pilot, when we get within
hail of the Yankee squadron."</p>

<p>"Come to anchor, sir?"<span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>"Certainly; come to anchor, until the fog clears off,
or we can get a little daylight. I don't want much."</p>

<p>"Well, that beats me!" ejaculated Captain Column.</p>

<p>"I shall hoist The Yankee flag over the Confederate;
then the Yankees will think this ship is a prize, and will
not fire into her."</p>

<p>"That beats me!" repeated the pilot.</p>

<p>"I came down here in a Yankee man-of-war, and I
made the arrangements for carrying this thing through
before I left her."</p>

<p>"O, yes, I see!" laughed Captain Column. "You
are playing them a Yankee trick."</p>

<p>"Exactly so!"</p>

<p>"Capital! capital!" exclaimed the pilot.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, the Ben Lomond came to anchor
under the lee of Sand Island, to wait for a favorable
time to continue her voyage.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">A YANKEE TRICK.</p>

<p>The rebel officers and crew of the Ben Lomond
were greatly astonished when the order was
given to let go the anchor. They were not in a
condition to appreciate the policy of stopping the wheels,
and waiting for daylight within hail of the blockading
squadron, re&euml;nforced as it had been for the attack on the
forts; but as the captain had the reputation of being a
perfect tiger, a fire-eater of the most ravenous sort, they
did not venture to grumble or make any complaints.</p>

<p>Captain Column, the pilot, chuckled, and declared it
was all right; the commander knew what he was about,
and would get the steamer out of the scrape without even
a shot from the Yankee men-of-war.</p>

<p>Somers had kept up his dignity and maintained his
self-possession in the exciting scenes through which he
had just passed; but it must not be thought that he was
as easy in mind as he appeared to be. Every moment
had been burdened with its own peculiar anxiety. The
least slip, the slightest accident, would expose him and<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
his brave followers to great peril, if not to capture and
death. He had won the day thus far by the mere force
of impudence and self-possession; but it was not without
a fear of failure, disgrace, and captivity.</p>

<p>But everything, up to this time, had worked admirably.
He had met and successfully turned aside the obstacles
which beset him; and when the Ben Lomond came to
anchor, the prospect looked more hopeful than at any
previous hour. It was now about two o'clock in the
morning. As there was nothing to do, he devoted an
hour to an examination of the vessel, which had been
fitted up at Mobile as a rebel cruiser. She had a heavy
rifled pivot gun amidships, and four broadside guns, and
was in every respect well provided for the work in which
she was to engage.</p>

<p>She was a vessel of about four hundred tons measurement,
long, narrow, and very sharp. Her rig was that
of a topsail schooner, and her smoke-stack raked with
her masts. She was a beautiful craft, and no labor or
expense had been spared to make her the fastest and
most elegant vessel afloat.</p>

<p>Even in the darkness, Somers could see enough of her
shape and fittings to excite his admiration. He passed
from the spar deck to the berth deck, where everything
was in keeping with her appearance above. The ward-room
was small, but it was comfortable and well arranged,
and the captain's cabin was fitted up like that of<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
a royal yacht. Probably Mr. Pillgrim had spent some
of his own money on these arrangements before she left
the Clyde; but what contributed distinctly to make her
a war steamer had been done after her arrival at Mobile.</p>

<p>Somers was delighted with the arrangements of the
prize, and as he examined the commander's cabin, he
could not help envying the man who was permitted to
occupy this sumptuous and convenient apartment; that
is, if the stars and stripes floated at the peak above him,
for he would rather have been a coal-heaver in a loyal
ship, than in command of the Ben Lomond under the
flag of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Swayne had conducted Somers over the vessel,
and pointed out to him those features which were most
worthy of notice.</p>

<p>"She is a splendid vessel," said the young commander,
as they paused in the ward-room.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I am but too happy in being appointed to
such a ship. If we only get clear of the Yankee squadron,
we shall give a good account of her."</p>

<p>"We shall have no quarrel with the Yankee ships,"
replied Somers, as he led the way to the spar deck again,
for he was not disposed, just yet, to let Pillgrim and
Langdon, who were confined there, hear his voice.</p>

<p>"Captain Pillgrim, you seem to be more confident on
this point than your officers," replied Swayne, in a gentle
tone, which more than insinuated that he would like
to know more of the commander's plans.<span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>Somers was very anxious that he should know more
of them, so as to prevent any suspicions which his subsequent
course might excite.</p>

<p>"From what point did you expect me to come, before
my arrival?" asked Somers.</p>

<p>"I had no idea. Mr. Langdon seemed to be familiar
with all your movements, but he did not say much about
them. He did remark, at one time, that you were
coming down as second lieutenant of one of the Yankee
men-of-war."</p>

<p>"Did he, indeed? Well, he was a prudent man, and
he will have his reward within a few days. Did he
really say that?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"I was deceived in him; he was not to be trusted. I
placed every confidence in him. What else did he tell
you?" asked Somers, artfully.</p>

<p>"Nothing else, sir. He said more to me than to any
other officer, and hardly anything to me."</p>

<p>"He has betrayed me."</p>

<p>"He told only me that you were to come in a Yankee
man-of-war."</p>

<p>"Yes, he did; the pilot knew it&mdash;spoke to me of it;
and very likely every man in the ship has the news.
But, Mr. Swayne, the statement was true."</p>

<p>"Mr. Langdon afterwards contradicted it, and said
you were in Richmond, and were coming down by land."<span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>"Probably he thought he had made a blunder. I did
come down in the Yankee ship, the Chatauqua. I am
third lieutenant of her, not second. I was sent off by
the captain, at my own suggestion, of course, to bring
out this vessel. I have done it&mdash;haven't I?"</p>

<p>"You have," laughed Swayne. "Then you are expected
by the Yankees?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>The first lieutenant of the Ben Lomond indulged in a
laugh highly complimentary to the skill and cleverness of
his commander. Somers laughed with him. It was an
excellent joke to both parties, though, like the Druid
shield, it was seen from different points of view.</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed Mr. Swayne, when he had
evaporated the foam of his mirth.</p>

<p>"If the fog clears off, I shall let up some rockets, which
will prevent the Yankees from firing at us. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I see, sir: you have the Yankee signals?" chuckled
Mr. Swayne.</p>

<p>"Every one of them. No doubt they are on the lookout
for me in every ship in the squadron."</p>

<p>"Excellent, Captain Pillgrim. This is, by all odds,
the best joke of the season."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Swayne, you will hoist the Yankee flag
over the Confederate."</p>

<p>"I don't like to do that, captain," added Mr. Swayne,
with a burst of patriotic enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>"For a purpose, Mr. Swayne. Of course, when the
men-of-war see that flag over the other, they will not
fire. We shall run through the squadron, as though we
belonged to it; and then&mdash;well, you will see what you
will see."</p>

<p>"Exactly so!" exclaimed Mr. Swayne, who seemed
to enjoy the prospect exceedingly, even independent of
his desire to flatter and "toady" to his commander.</p>

<p>The flags were hoisted as Somers directed, and the
"captain" for a couple of hours planked the deck in
silence, impatiently waiting for the fog to lift, or for the
daylight to come. It was his policy to anchor, because he
was fearful that the steamer would run by the squadron,
in the fog and darkness, and it would excite suspicion to
return to the fleet, after safely passing through it. If
Mr. Swayne had suspected any treachery, or that everything
was not as it appeared to be, it would have gone
hard with Somers and his men, for he could call in
double the loyal force to assist him, besides releasing
Pillgrim and Langdon.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning, the fog lifted, and
Somers directed the rockets to be discharged, and the
steamer to be got under way. Though anxious to keep
up appearances, he quietly directed Tom Longstone to
make as much delay as possible, and by some accident
the messenger parted when the anchor was apeak, and
it was necessary to do the work over again.<span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>"Captain Pillgrim, what shall be done with the men
who came on board with you?" asked Mr. Swayne,
while the crew were walking round the capstan.</p>

<p>"What shall be done with them?" asked Somers, apparently
not comprehending the meaning of the question.</p>

<p>"They are Yankees&mdash;are they not?"</p>

<p>"They are true men, Mr. Swayne. I selected them
for this very duty, and I know them."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, I heard one of them singing a Yankee
song, just now."</p>

<p>"They have been in the habit of singing such songs
lately; but they are true men, and will stand by me to
the last. If I had wanted them, I might have brought
off a hundred of the crew of the Chatauqua."</p>

<p>Somers told a great many truths in the course of the
night, for the purpose of deceiving the enemies of his
country, which is a very anomalous duty for truth to
perform.</p>

<p>The anchor was at the hawse hole, was "catted and
fished;" and the Ben Lomond moved on again, with the
pilot on the bridge. As the fog lifted, and the daylight
increased, the squadron of "Brave Old Salt" was seen
by Somers and his companions. As he had promised,
not a ship fired on the steamer, or offered to molest her.
The first lieutenant, pilot, and other officers were entirely
satisfied that everything was working in exact
accordance with the plans of their "smart" commander,
as they already called him.<span class="pagenum">[251]</span></p>

<p>The exciting moment when all the delusion would be
swept away, and the rebel officers and seamen find themselves
prisoners, and their ship a prize, was at hand.
Somers had already arranged his final movements with
the boatswain, and certain of the men were instructed to
perform particular parts in the closing scene of the drama.</p>

<p>"Now, Captain Column," said Somers to the pilot,
"we must run down for the Chatauqua. She is the last
vessel in the squadron, and if we appear to be moving
towards her, nothing will be suspected."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, captain," replied the pilot, shaking his
fat sides with laughter at the Yankee trick which they
were playing off upon the originators of this species of
pleasantry.</p>

<p>"It is quite smooth this morning. The wind has all
gone down. Run right under the quarter of the Chatauqua."</p>

<p>"I can take her within six feet of the ship, if you
like."</p>

<p>"Not too close."</p>

<p>"They will give us three cheers, won't they?" laughed
the pilot.</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Port!" shouted the pilot, as the Ben Lomond approached
the Chatauqua.</p>

<p>"Port!" yelled the quartermaster at the helm, at
whose side stood Tom Longstone.<span class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>

<p>"Port!" repeated the pilot with greater energy, when
he saw that the head of the steamer was swinging off
from the Chatauqua.</p>

<p>"Port!" again responded the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"Starboard a little more," said Tom, in a low tone.</p>

<p>Captain Column began to storm because the helm did
not go to port as he ordered.</p>

<p>"Can't help it, sir. The tiller chains are jammed,
sir," replied the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"Now hard a port!" said Tom Longstone.</p>

<p>"Starboard! Hard a starboard!" screamed the pilot,
in tones of fury.</p>

<p>"Helm is jammed, sir!" returned the boatswain.</p>

<p>At this moment the bells were rung to stop, and then
to back the engine. To all but the half dozen loyal seamen
who stood near the helm, everything seemed to be
in confusion. The Ben Lomond ran up on the lee side
of the Chatauqua, and stopped within a few feet of her.
A stroke of the wheels and a turn of the helm brought
her alongside, before the rebels could clearly apprehend
the situation. The twenty-four men, with their revolvers
and cutlasses, stood ready to check any demonstration on
the part of officers or crew, but none was made. Their
weapons were in the armory, and they suspected nothing
till an instant before the steamer touched the ship's side.</p>

<p>Conant, as instructed, leaped on board the Chatauqua,
and reported Somers's wish to the officer of the deck.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
In another moment, the watch on deck of the man-of-war
poured into the prize, and secured every officer and
seaman. Then came the three rousing cheers which the
pilot had expected, and the work was done.</p>

<p>If ever a rebel was disappointed, disheartened, and
disgusted, it was Mr. Swayne. He had been bewildered
by the sudden change in the course of the steamer, and
actually believed that it was caused by the wheel chains
being jammed, until the watch from the Chatauqua
poured in upon her decks.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Swayne, I suppose you are satisfied that I
spoke the truth. The Yankees have not fired upon us;
I came down in the Chatauqua; I was sent off to bring
out this vessel; I have done it," said Somers.</p>

<p>"I had no suspicion you were a Yankee," replied the
first lieutenant. "Where did you get your commission?"</p>

<p>"It was given me by Mr. Langdon and Mr. Pillgrim,
both of whom are under guard below."</p>

<p>Swayne used some expletives more forcible than polite,
and Somers went on board the Chatauqua to report.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="h3">PILLGRIM AND LANGDON.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to report the capture of the
Ben Lomond, otherwise the Tallapoosa," said
Somers, as he advanced towards Mr. Hackleford,
his face red with blushes, and his heart bounding
with emotion.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant of the Chatauqua had regarded his
enterprise with a want of faith, to say the least; and
when the young commander of the expedition came forward
to report its entire success, there was something
like pride and exultation in his manner, mingling not ungracefully
with the manifestations of his natural modesty.
He had done "a big thing;" he felt that he had done
"a big thing;" and it would have been a ridiculous
affectation for him to pretend, by word or manner, that
he had not done "a big thing."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you upon your success, Mr. Somers,"
replied Mr. Hackleford, warmly. "I was sceptical, I
confess; but no man in the fleet is happier than I am at
your good fortune."<span class="pagenum">[255]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Somers, blushing more deeply
than before, and almost wishing that the first lieutenant
had done the "big thing" instead of himself, because he
was so kind and generous in his commendation.</p>

<p>"You have managed the affair with skill and energy.
For my own part, I did not believe you would even get
into the bay, let alone capturing the vessel. I am astonished
at your success, but none the less delighted because
I am surprised."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," was all Somers could say in reply
to this praise so magnanimously bestowed.</p>

<p>"Captain Cascabel will see you, in his cabin, and we
will hear your verbal report there."</p>

<p>Mr. Garboard had already gone on board the prize,
hauled her off from the ship, where she was chafing her
sides, and moored her a cable's length distant. Somers
went below, where he was as warmly and generously
greeted by the captain as he had been by the first lieutenant.
He related the story of his night's adventures to
them with all necessary minuteness. His auditors could
not help laughing when he told them what he had done
with his old friends, the first lieutenant and the commander
of the rebel craft. He had acted on his theory
of Pillgrim's intended movements, and thus kept himself
above suspicion.</p>

<p>"How does Mr. Pillgrim appear?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him, sir; I was very careful not to<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
let him see me. Mr. Swayne, the first lieutenant of the
Ben Lomond, after I had disposed of Langdon, managed
him for me."</p>

<p>"It's a very amusing as well as a very exciting affair.
But we must see these officers. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Under guard in the state-rooms of the prize, sir."</p>

<p>"Bring them on board, if you please, Mr. Somers.
Get your breakfast first."</p>

<p>Somers went to the ward-room, where he breakfasted
with the officers off duty. He was cordially congratulated
upon his success, though perhaps some of the mess
regarded him as rather exclusive in permitting none of
them to share his laurels.</p>

<p>After breakfast the first cutter was cleared away, and
Somers pulled to the prize in her. The Ben Lomond
was temporarily in charge of the second lieutenant of
the Chatauqua, who had secured the prisoners, and put
everything in order on board. Somers went at once to
the ward-room, where the two most important prisoners
were confined. There were now at each door a couple
of marines with loaded muskets, but no communication
had been had with the solitary occupant of either.</p>

<p>Pillgrim had several times attempted to obtain some
information in regard to what was going on, but he was
still in darkness. Even the bull's eye in his room could
not have enlightened him, for it was on the starboard side
of the steamer, while the Chatauqua lay on the port side.<span class="pagenum">[257]</span></p>

<p>Somers ordered the marines to open the door of Langdon's
room first, and the late first lieutenant of the Tallapoosa
came forth.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Wynkoop, I believe," said Somers, facetiously.</p>

<p>Langdon looked at him with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Have you any more old sherry that has made two
voyages to India?"</p>

<p>"This is hardly magnanimous, Mr. Somers," said
Langdon, coldly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but when officers stoop to such tricks
as those you have practised, there can be no great harm
in mentioning them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I find myself somewhat bewildered."</p>

<p>"I dare say," laughed Somers. "Very likely your
friend Pillgrim, or Coles, is in the same situation."</p>

<p>"Is he on board?"</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"I have not seen him since he left Philadelphia in the
Chatauqua."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"You were in the Chatauqua with him?"</p>

<p>"For a short time."</p>

<p>"I had a letter from him, dated at Richmond, saying
that he had changed his plans."</p>

<p>"Changed them&mdash;did he?" said Somers, who had<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
changed them for him. "Perhaps you will inform me
how you happened to be on board this vessel."</p>

<p>"I don't object; it makes little difference what I say
now. After obtaining the command of the Tallapoosa
for Pillgrim, I went to Wilmington, where I was to take
command of the Coosa."</p>

<p>"You mean the Ben Nevis."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I thought you were to call her the Louisiana."</p>

<p>"We did not always give you correct information,"
added Langdon, with a sickly smile.</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"While at Wilmington I got a letter from Pillgrim,
then in Richmond, informing me that the Ben Nevis had
been captured, and that I was appointed first lieutenant
of the Tallapoosa, if I chose to take the place. I did
choose to take it, hoping soon to be in command of one
of the California steamers. I went to Mobile at once,
and attended to the fitting out of the ship. Pillgrim
wrote me that he should be on board by the 22d, and
I had steam up to run out the moment he arrived."</p>

<p>"How happened you to tell your officers that Pillgrim
was coming down in a Yankee man-of-war?" asked
Somers.</p>

<p>"That was his original plan. Though he wrote me
from Richmond, I did not know but that he intended to
return to the Chatauqua. He gave me no particulars;<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
did not tell me that his plans had failed, only that he had
changed them. When he wrote that he should be on
board by the 22d, I knew he was coming down by land,
and I corrected my statement. Now, Mr. Somers, will
you tell me how you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"Marine, bring out the other prisoner," said Somers,
who had been instructed by Captain Cascabel to confer
with the conspirators, if he could obtain any information
from them.</p>

<p>The discomfited, crestfallen commander of the Tallapoosa
was brought from his room by a marine. He saw
Somers, and started back with astonishment. He was
pale and haggard, as though he had been spending his
time in drinking bad whiskey, and in other debauchery.
He had upon his face a fortnight's growth of black beard,
and looked more like "Coles" than when Somers had
last met him. His captor concluded that his misfortunes
on board the Chatauqua had depressed his spirits, in spite
of the cool look he had before carried, and that he had
given way to dissipation. He certainly appeared like a
person who had just come out of a hard "spree."</p>

<p>In the Ben Lomond there was a door opening from the
ward-room into the captain's cabin. The vessel had
evidently been built for a swift passenger steamer. The
ward-room was a portion of the main cabin, from which
the steerage and engineers' rooms had been parted off;
while the captain's cabin was the original "ladies'<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
saloon." Langdon had been conducted by the marines
through this door to the captain's cabin, where the
conversation with him had taken place. Pillgrim was in
the same manner introduced to this apartment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers!" exclaimed the traitor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. In the letter you sent me from Old Point
Comfort,&mdash;and I am greatly obliged to you for the
information contained in that letter,&mdash;you expressed a
hope that you should meet me on board of the Ben
Lomond. Your wish has been realized," replied Somers,
taking the original letter, with other papers, from his
pocket.</p>

<p>Pillgrim trembled in every fibre of his frame. It was
not thus he had hoped to meet his enemy.</p>

<p>"'If you capture the Ben Lomond, it will make you
a lieutenant. Do it, by all means,'" continued Somers,
reading the last paragraph of the letter. "This was
your advice. I have done it."</p>

<p>Pillgrim made no reply. His pale, haggard face,
darkened by his half-grown beard, was contorted by
emotion, and his bloodshot eyes had lost their fire.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to enjoy the situation so much as
your letter intimated that you would."</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I am your prisoner," said he, with a
desperate struggle.</p>

<p>"You are; you will not have the pleasure of hanging
me at the yard-arm."<span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>"I am bewildered&mdash;overcome."</p>

<p>"So was Langdon."</p>

<p>"I see why you did not join your ship before," said
Langdon, with a sneer, as he glanced contemptuously at
his principal. "You have been dissipating."</p>

<p>This remark brought forth an angry retort from Pillgrim,
and for a few moments each traitor reproached and
vilified the other, much to the amusement of the marines,
and to the disgust of Somers, who was compelled to interfere.
Langdon's severest charge against his late captain
was, that he had betrayed their schemes by writing
letters, and in other stupid ways. Pillgrim denied it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers has just thanked you for the information
contained in your letter," sneered Langdon. "He has
good reason to do so."</p>

<p>"I gave him no information that could be of any service
to him."</p>

<p>"You gave him the name of the vessel," retorted
Langdon.</p>

<p>"But I did not tell him where she was."</p>

<p>"You gave me that information, Mr. Langdon," said
Somers, quietly.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>Somers exhibited the letter in cipher.</p>

<p>"You could not read that without the key," protested
the writer of the note.</p>

<p>"The first word I made out was 'Langdon:' the<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
next, 'Ben Lomond.' I am indebted to both of you.
The moral of the whole affair is, that treason cannot
prosper. I am indebted to both of you for the information
which enabled me to capture the steamer. Gentlemen,
it becomes my duty to conduct you on board of the
Chatauqua."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Somers!" groaned Pillgrim, "spare me
that."</p>

<p>"I must obey my orders."</p>

<p>The traitor objected strongly to being taken into the
presence of the officers of the ship in which he had so
recently served. He protested that he had but a few
days to live, and begged to be saved from this humiliation.
But Somers, though he was not without pity for
the degraded and disgraced wretch, had no alternative
but to obey the orders of Captain Cascabel.</p>

<p>Langdon accepted his misfortunes with more resignation.
He was quite cheerful, and volunteered to tell all
he knew, though he was very bitter against Pillgrim,
who, he declared, had ruined all their hopes by his dissipation,
his silly pretensions, and his reckless exposure of
their plans.</p>

<p>Somers was now satisfied that Pillgrim had been intoxicated
when he came over the side of the Ben Lomond
the night before, which accounted for his violent
conduct, and which was one of the accidents which
assisted in the easy capture of the vessel.<span class="pagenum">[263]</span></p>

<p>Both the prisoners were examined on board the Chatauqua;
and, with the explanations of Somers, their
operations were clearly comprehended. They were placed
in confinement, to await the final decision in regard to
them. In the forenoon Somers was sent to make his
report to the admiral. He was warmly received, judiciously
commended, and courteously dismissed. The
young officer's respect and admiration for the "Brave Old
Salt" were not diminished by his second interview.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Ben Lomond, in charge of an acting
ensign, was sent to Pensacola, where she was to
remain until further orders. It was surmised that the
admiral, not wishing to spare any of the best officers of
the fleet, when on the eve of a mighty event, had decided
to let the prize remain in port with her prisoners until a
more favorable season. Be this as it may, the Old Salamander
kept everybody busy for the next ten days, when,
the monitors having arrived, and all the ships intended
for the attack being in complete readiness, the order was
given for the battle, which now stands without a parallel
in the annals of naval warfare.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BATTLE OF MOBILE BAY.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the importance of the tremendous
action in Mobile Bay, it is necessary to
consider that Mobile and Wilmington were the
only available ports of the rebels east of the
Mississippi. The resources of the Confederacy were
exhausted by three years of wasting war, and it was
dependent upon foreign supplies for the means of continuing
the strife. The earnest attention of the government
at Washington, therefore, was directed to the shutting
up of these ports.</p>

<p>To form a correct idea of the obstacles to the closing
of Mobile Bay, which had been intrusted to Admiral
Farragut, it should be remembered that its entrance was
guarded by two strongly-built and heavily-armed forts;
that the only available channel for large vessels, but
three fourths of a mile in width, ran under the guns of
Fort Morgan, the stronger of the two forts; that this
channel was filled with sunken torpedoes, which, experience
had demonstrated, were fatal to any vessels subjected<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
to the explosion; and that the rebels had a fleet of gunboats
and iron-clads, which could operate with every
advantage against an advancing fleet.</p>

<p>"Brave Old Salt" had estimated all these obstacles,
and believing that "success was a duty," he had resolved
to overcome them. All the expedients which the ingenuity
of a thorough seaman could devise were adopted to
strengthen and protect the ships. The plan of the battle
was entirely original, and displayed the genius of its
author. The admiral modestly declares that he only
obeyed the orders of the navy department, and disclaims
the credit so lavishly awarded to him by his admiring
fellow-citizens; but the government did not tell him how
to do it&mdash;and in that consisted the doing of it&mdash;did not
order him to "lash ships" and take his elevated position
in the main rigging; did not bid him "butt" the rebel
rams with his wooden prows; and for all these things
does the whole world sound his praise.</p>

<p>At half past five in the morning the Chatauqua, with
the Androscoggin lashed to her port side, took her position
in the line of battle. The Brooklyn was to lead the
van, with the "Old Hartford," the flag-ship, next in the
line, though the doughty old admiral had but tardily
acceded to the request of his officers in taking this place.
The position of the Chatauqua was in the centre of the
line of battle.</p>

<p>At the signal from the admiral, the fleet moved on.<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
Every officer was full of zeal and enthusiasm, though it
was certain that some of them would never behold the
light of another day; that more or less of the gallant
vessels must soon be overwhelmed by the hidden engines
of destruction which had been planted in the channel.
Somers regarded it as the great day of his existence.
He had read his Testament and said his prayers that
morning as though it were the last day he had to live,
for the most fearful and deadly strife of the whole war
was anticipated. A man is never so fully prepared to
live well and do his duty faithfully as when he is ready
to die.</p>

<p>While the young officer thought even more tenderly
than usual of the loved ones in his far-off home, and of
that other loved one who was never forgotten when home
was remembered, he felt that his country was theirs, and
that every blow struck for the nation was struck for
them. To die for his country was to die for them&mdash;for
his own home; and he asked no higher duty than to sacrifice
his life, if such was the will of God. "Thy will
be done," he repeated many times, though life was full
of hopes and joys to him.</p>

<p>The fleet moved on, and the roar of the great guns in
the monitors soon announced that the action had commenced.
The chase guns of the Chatauqua opened first,
and the ship trembled beneath the concussion.</p>

<p>"The Tecumseh has gone down," passed from mouth<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
to mouth, as a tremendous explosion saluted the ears of
the seamen.</p>

<p>The monitor had struck upon a torpedo, and in a moment
had disappeared beneath the tide, carrying down
with her nearly all her gallant crew. But this incident,
appalling as it was even to the battle-scarred veterans on
the decks of the fleet, was hardly heeded in the terrible
determination of purpose which animated every heart.
The Brooklyn paused to dodge some supposed torpedo
buoys, and "Brave Old Salt" dashed ahead in the Hartford
to his proper place in the van of the battle.</p>

<p>The ships in pairs came up abreast of the fort; and
according to the orders of the admiral, the broadside and
other guns opened upon the works, not with solid shot, in
futile attempts to batter down their dense walls, but with
grape, which drove the gunners of the fort from their
stations.</p>

<p>Never were guns fired more rapidly; and the roar was
tremendous, shaking all earth beneath, and enveloping
the scene in dense volumes of smoke, above which, as it
occasionally rolled away, might be seen the admiral,
lashed to the main rigging of the Hartford. A glimpse
at him never failed to call forth the most unbounded enthusiasm,
among officers and seamen.</p>

<p>With comparatively little injury the fleet passed the
fort, and standing to the north-west to clear the Middle
Ground, was out of the reach of its guns. Terrible
<a id="Page_268"></a><span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
stories of the torpedoes had been told by deserters and
refugees, but the admiral's hopes had been realized; they
had been so long in the water that they had become
"innocuous."</p>

<p>But a new and greater danger menaced the fleet. The
rebel iron-clad Tennessee started out from under the guns
of Fort Morgan. She was a formidable adversary; and
though the monitors were depended upon to "neutralize"
or destroy her, they moved so slowly and steered so badly,
that the brunt of the battle was borne by the wooden
ships.</p>

<p>"Run her down," was the order from the admiral,
which the signal officer interpreted on the quarter deck
of the Chatauqua.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="caption">The Battle of Mobile Bay. <a href="#Page_268">Page 268</a>.</p><p>Captain Cascabel instantly ordered full head of steam
to be put on, and the ship, gathering headway, dashed
down upon the Tennessee, striking her at right angles,
near the after part of the casemate. The shock of the
concussion was terrible. The men were thrown from
their feet, and the ship groaned in bitterness of spirit at
the hard usage to which she was subjected. Her stem
was crushed in to the plank ends, and the water began to
pour into the forward store-rooms. Expecting such an
event, the carpenter and his gang were at the threatened
point, and prevented any disaster from the collision.</p>

<p>The effect upon the iron-clad was hardly perceptible,
<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>giving her a heavy list, but apparently inflicting no damage
upon her. The Chatauqua swung round as she
struck. Captain Cascabel, who had leaped into the
mizzen rigging, gave his orders, which were promptly
executed by Mr. Hackleford. Solid shot and shell were
poured into the ram with a fury which would have been
fatal to a less strongly built craft. As it was, one of her
port shutters was struck and shattered, the rest of the
shot bounding off like peas from an oak floor.</p>

<p>"Hah, you bloody villains of Yankees!" shouted the
rebels, at their ports.</p>

<p>"How are you, Johnny Reb?" replied a fore-top man,
as he hurled a spittoon in at the port.</p>

<p>Another old salt dashed in a holy-stone, and then the
marines opened fire upon them with their muskets.</p>

<p>"Ram her again!" shouted the admiral from the main
rigging of the Hartford, as the flag-ship dashed at the
game.</p>

<p>The Chatauqua swept round, and succeeded in striking
the Tennessee again, but with no better result than
before. At the same time she poured in shot and shell
from every available gun.</p>

<p>At this moment one of the ships struck the Hartford,
by accident, in the dense smoke, and knocked two of her
ports into one. It was believed that the flag-ship would
go down, for her planking was stove in within two feet
of the water-line.</p>

<p>"Save the admiral! save the admiral!" shouted the<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
men; and there was not one of them who would not
have died by fire or water to rescue their beloved leader.</p>

<p>Somers sprang upon the rail, to observe the catastrophe,
and to be in readiness to save the admiral if an
opportunity occurred. While he stood there, a shot hit
the rail diagonally, a splinter struck him in the side, and
he dropped helpless into the water.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers is wounded and fallen overboard!"
shouted the captain of the pivot gun amidships.</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth, before
another man dropped into the water from one of the
ports. It was Tom Longstone. He found his young
friend, and bearing him up with his strong arm, both
were rescued from their perilous position.</p>

<p>"She shows the white flag! She surrenders!" was
the cry, as the boatswain and Somers reached the deck.</p>

<p>The young officer was borne to the ward-room at the
moment of victory, while the cheers of the brave tars
were ringing through the fleet.</p>

<p>The Tennessee and the Selma had surrendered, the
Gaines had been driven ashore, and the Morgan was for
the present safe under the guns of the fort. The victory
was complete and decisive.</p>

<p>Somers was severely, if not dangerously, injured. He
was borne tenderly to his state-room by his brother officers,
as the cheers for the great victory were sounding
through the fleet. There had been seven men killed and<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
thirty-five wounded on board the Chatauqua. The surgeon
was in the cockpit, busily engaged in attending to
the wounds of the poor fellows, and could not immediately
examine the young officer, who, it was evident, required
no surgical operation.</p>

<p>The ship, though considerably cut up by the shots from
the fort and from the rebel steamers, was still in condition
for active service. The fleet anchored in the bay, out of
the reach of the guns of Fort Morgan. Officers were
busy in making the necessary surveys, and the men were
occupied in repairing damages and restoring order about
the decks and rigging.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Mr. Somers?" asked Mr. Hackleford,
entering the sufferer's room, as soon as he could
leave the deck.</p>

<p>"I do not suffer much pain, sir; but I am afraid I am
badly damaged in the hull," replied Somers, with a languid
smile.</p>

<p>He was very pale, and lay very still. He was numb
from the effects of the shock given him by the splinter,
and some of the functions of his frame seemed to be suspended.
The first lieutenant was alarmed, and sent a
second messenger for the surgeon, who presently made
his appearance, having disposed of the severest cases in
the cockpit.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him, doctor?" asked Mr.
Hackleford.<span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>"I fear he is badly injured," replied Dr. De Plesion,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Dangerously?" whispered the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head.</p>

<p>"Speak out, doctor," said the patient, faintly. "I am
not afraid to die for my country. Please tell me the
truth."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell yet, Mr. Somers. Three of the ribs
are fractured, but if he is not injured internally, he will
do very well," added the surgeon, to Mr. Hackleford.</p>

<p>"I have but little pain," said the patient.</p>

<p>"You will have more, Mr. Somers, by night," continued
Dr. De Plesion. "I do not discover any internal
injury."</p>

<p>"I hope there is none," said the first lieutenant.
"You are too good an officer to be spared, Mr. Somers,&mdash;I
mean for even a brief period, of course."</p>

<p>The report of the surgeon was anxiously awaited by
the captain and all the ward-room officers, for the third
lieutenant had been a universal favorite, and his capture
of the Ben Lomond, and his gallant conduct during the
action with the forts and the Tennessee, had not diminished
his popularity. Of all who waited the doctor's
decision, none took the matter so much to heart as the
boatswain, who had saved him from drowning while he
was helpless in the water. Mr. Hackleford noticed him
at his duty, still wet to the skin, and kindly gave him
permission to visit his young friend.<span class="pagenum">[273]</span></p>

<p>"I shall not go by the board, Tom," said Somers.
"You and I may yet make another cruise together."</p>

<p>"Thank God! I hope so," exclaimed the boatswain,
encouraged by these cheerful words.</p>

<p>"Tom, I owe my life to you."</p>

<p>"O, never mind that, my darling! What would I
have done if you had slipped your wind?"</p>

<p>"You would have done your duty, as you always do,
my good fellow."</p>

<p>"I dare say I should, Mr. Somers, but I can only
thank God that you are alive now," replied the boatswain,
as the tears flowed down his bronzed cheek, and
he turned to leave the room.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="h3">IN THE HOSPITAL.</p>

<p>Under the arrangement made by Admiral Farragut
with the commander of Fort Morgan, the
wounded of both sides were sent in the Metacomet
to Pensacola. Somers was of the number, and he
was borne from his berth in the Chatauqua to the
steamer, though the removal caused him great pain.
The numbness of his side was beginning to pass away,
and the parts to become very sensitive.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I am sorry to see you in this condition,"
said "Brave Old Salt," who was present with a
kind word for the suffering heroes of the battle. "You
behaved nobly during the fight, as I am told you always
do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. You are very kind," moaned Somers,
in his pain and weakness.</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten you, my brave fellow," continued
the admiral. "The capture of the Ben Lomond
was a matter of more consequence than you can appreciate,
perhaps; and your faith and skill in doing this
work entitle you to the gratitude of your country."<span class="pagenum">[275]</span></p>

<p>"I am happy in having merited your approbation."</p>

<p>"You have behaved gallantly in the action; and, I
repeat, you shall be remembered. What can I do for
you, Mr. Somers?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more for me, admiral. You have done more
for me now than I deserve. Mr. Longstone, the boatswain
of the Chatauqua, who saved my life&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all about him, Mr. Somers. He was your
right-hand man in the capture of the Ben Lomond."</p>

<p>"He was, sir."</p>

<p>"He shall not be forgotten."</p>

<p>"I have already been rewarded more than I deserve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. Mr. Pillgrim promised you a lieutenant's
commission, if you brought out his steamer. I
ratify that promise. As to the boatswain, it is a pity he
is not an educated man; but he shall be cared for."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>But Somers was too faint to talk any longer, and the
admiral passed to other of the noble fellows who had
been wounded on that eventful day. The sufferer's cot
was placed on the ward-room floor, for the state-rooms
and berths were already full. In one of them lay Admiral
Buchanan, who had commanded the rebel fleet.
He had been wounded in the leg in the battle, and he
had lost the battle itself, which, to a proud, brave spirit,
was worse than losing a leg.<span class="pagenum">[276]</span></p>

<p>Somers was now suffering the most intense pain, which
he bore like a hero. Tom Longstone bent tenderly over
him, his eyes filled with tears, and uttered his adieus.
With a hand as gentle as a woman's, he pillowed his
head on the couch, and smoothed back his hair from his
eyes. He would gladly have gone with his wounded
friend, to lave his fevered brow and speak words of comfort
and encouragement to him; but neither of them
thought of such a thing, for the admiral's fleet was in the
enemy's waters, and every man was needed at his post.</p>

<p>The Metacomet, having received her precious freight
of mangled heroes, cast off her moorings, and, passing
the fort, turned her prow to the eastward. On her
arrival at Pensacola, the sufferers were transferred to
the hospital, where they received every attention which
willing hands and generous hearts could bestow.</p>

<p>Fort Morgan surrendered to the combined forces of
the army and navy before the end of the month, and
Mobile Bay was in undisputed possession of the government.
The work undertaken by the brave admiral had
been fully completed. Mobile was now a cipher, so far
as the Confederacy was concerned, though a great bluster
was made of defending it to the last.</p>

<p>Somers had been three weeks in the hospital, and
doubtless owed his life to the skill of the surgeon and
the attentions of the nurses. He had been injured internally,
as Dr. De Plesion feared; but he had begun to<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
improve, though he was still unable to sit up. He had endured
the severest pain, and the doctor had not concealed
from him his fears of a fatal result, because the patience
and firmness, but especially the religious faith, of the sufferer
warranted him in doing so.</p>

<p>Day after day and night after night Somers struggled
with his condition, in faith, patience, and resignation.
He felt that he was ready to leave the world, full of joys
and hopes as it was, for the purer hopes and brighter
joys of the eternal world beyond the grave. He thought
of his mother, and wished that she might be with him to
smooth his dying pillow, if he must die; but it was not
the will of God, and he did not murmur. He thought
of Kate Portington. He would like to see her once
more before he passed away, but this was a vain wish;
and from her and the loved ones at home he turned to
the glorious realities of the immortal life&mdash;fitting theme
for one who was trembling between life and death.</p>

<p>In the midst of his pain and earthly loneliness he was
happy. He could not but recall the scene of Phil Kennedy's
death-bed; of the agony of remorse which shook
him, as he looked back upon his past life; of the terrors
with which his stricken conscience invested the grave.
Then the sufferer, in the deepest depths of his heart,
thanked God that he had been enabled to be true to himself
and to duty. He was happy in the past, happy in
the hope of the future. There was much to regret and<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
to repent of; but as he did regret and repent, he felt that
he was forgiven.</p>

<p>He was happy; and the joy of that hour, when an
approving conscience triumphs over bodily pain, and
decks the waiting tomb with flowers, was worth the
struggle with the legions of temptations which all must
encounter.</p>

<p>We are best fitted to live when best prepared to die.
Somers waited with hope and resignation for the angel
of death, but he came not. The very calmness with
which he regarded the open tomb, assisted in closing its
portals to him. At the end of two weeks the doctor
spoke more of life than of death; at the end of three he
spoke not at all of the grim messenger&mdash;grim he was,
even when he wore the chaplet of flowers with which
Faith and Hope ever crown him.</p>

<p>Somers was out of danger. The internal inflammation
passed away, and the patient began to mend. He
thought of life now, of meeting the loved ones who, afar
off, had sadly spoken farewells to him when he departed
from their presence, with all the fearful perils of storm
and battle hanging over him.</p>

<p>On the day after the news of the surrender of Fort
Morgan arrived, the Chatauqua dropped her anchor off
Pensacola. A boat immediately put off from her, containing
Boatswain Longstone, who landed, and hastened
to the hospital with all possible speed. Probably there<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
had hardly been an hour since the Metacomet left Mobile
Bay with the wounded, in which Tom had not thought of
Somers. The old man was as eager and impatient as a
child, and could hardly submit to the formalities necessary
to procure admission to the hospital.</p>

<p>"My darling!" exclaimed the veteran, as he crept up
to the bed of his young friend.</p>

<p>He walked lightly, and spoke softly and tenderly, for
he knew how sick Somers had been.</p>

<p>"Ah, Tom, I am glad to see you," replied the patient,
as he extended his thin hand, which the boatswain
eagerly seized, though he handled it as tenderly as a
bashful youth does the hand of the maiden he loves.
"It does my eyes good to look upon you, Tom."</p>

<p>"Jack, I've been dying to see you. They told me
you were in a bad way, and might slip your cable any
moment."</p>

<p>"I have not expected to live, until a week ago."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Jack! I was never so happy in my
life;" and the boatswain actually wept,&mdash;great, strong,
weather-stained veteran as he was, who had breasted the
storms of four and thirty years on the ocean.</p>

<p>"I know how you feel, Tom."</p>

<p>"So you may, Jack,&mdash;I beg pardon, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me Jack, now," interposed Somers, with a faint
smile; "it sounds like old times. You have been the
making of me, Tom, and we won't stand on ceremony,
as long as we are not on board the ship."<span class="pagenum">[280]</span></p>

<p>The boatswain still held the attenuated hand of his
sick friend, and they talked of the past and of the present;
of the battle, and of the subsequent events in the
bay. But Tom Longstone seemed to be thinking all the
time of something else.</p>

<p>"What have you got on, Tom?" asked Somers, as he
noticed a "foul anchor" on his shoulder, and a band of
gold lace on his sleeve.</p>

<p>"What have I got on? Why, I always wear my
colors, of course," replied Tom, with a smile of the deepest
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"But those are not the colors of a boatswain in the
United States Navy."</p>

<p>"That's a fact, Jack. I'm not a boatswain, just now."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"I'm an acting ensign."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" exclaimed Somers, not less pleased
than the veteran.</p>

<p>"It's a fact, my darling; but before we spin any more
yarns, here's a document for you. Shall I open it?" continued
Tom, as he took from his breast pocket a huge
official envelope, whose appearance was entirely familiar
to Somers.</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>It was directed to "Lieutenant John Somers;" and
the superscription sufficiently indicated the nature of its
contents.<span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>"God bless the admiral!" said Somers.</p>

<p>"God bless the admiral!" repeated Tom, glancing
reverently upward as he spoke.</p>

<p>The commission was dated before the news of the battle
in Mobile Bay could have reached Washington. It
followed the reception of the despatches concerning the
capture of the Ben Lomond; and Tom Longstone had
been made an acting ensign, though he still retained his
warrant as a boatswain, for his conduct in the same
affair.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Tom, on this promotion," said
Somers.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jack; and I congratulate you as Lieutenant
Somers. You are a 'regular,' but I'm only an
'acting,'" replied the veteran. "When the war's over,
I shall be a boatswain again."</p>

<p>"I am more rejoiced for you than for myself, Tom."</p>

<p>"Just like you, Jack. If I made you, I'm sure you
made me. I got my rating as boatswain's mate in the
Rosalie through you, and then I was made a boatswain
for what I did with you. Now I'm an ensign by your
doings. I suppose you think I'm not up to it, Jack."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I know you are. There's nothing about
a ship that you don't know as well as the admiral himself,
except&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except," laughed Tom, as Somers paused, "except
what?"<span class="pagenum">[282]</span></p>

<p>"Navigation."</p>

<p>"I know something about that, Jack&mdash;I do, upon my
honor."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it."</p>

<p>"When I first went into the navy, I was a regular
sea dandy. I used big words, as long as the coach-whip;
but I soon found a man must not talk above his
station. When I was a young man, I wasn't a bad
scholar. I went to the academy, and learned surveying;
I meant to be a surveyor; but I got a hitch, and went
to sea."</p>

<p>"A hitch?"</p>

<p>"Well, I never mention it now. Squire Kent's daughter
didn't treat me as handsomely as she did another
young fellow, and I drank more liquor than was good for
me. I got run down; and when I had payed out all the
respectability I had, I went to sea. That cured me of
drinking; in fact, I became a temperance man before
the grog rations were stopped in the navy. As I said, I
was pretty well educated, and talked as well as the officers
on the quarter deck. But my shipmates laughed at
me, and I soon dropped down into using sea slang."</p>

<p>"I have noticed that your speech has been wonderfully
improved since you were made a boatswain."</p>

<p>"I've been trying to cure my bad habits. I've been
lying round loose in the navy for thirty years before the
war began. I tried to be honest and true, but the war<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
has set me right up. I haven't told you the best of the
news yet, Jack."</p>

<p>"What more?"</p>

<p>"You are appointed to the Ben Lomond as prize
master, and I'm going with you as second officer. The
admiral says you shall take the prize home, if she has to
wait two months for you. She is yours, and you shall
have the command of her."</p>

<p>"He is very kind; but I do not think I shall be able
to take command at present."</p>

<p>"We are to go as soon as the doctor will let you be
carried on board of her. Jack, the Ben Lomond is
going into the navy; and if I mistake not, she will be in
command of Lieutenant Somers."</p>

<p>"That would be the height of my ambition. Indeed,
I never aspired to anything so great as the command of
a fine steamer."</p>

<p>"You'll have her; the admiral is your friend. If you
do, I shall be in the ward-room. Splinter my timber-heads!
Only think of that! Tom Longstone a ward-room
officer!"</p>

<p>"You deserve it, Tom."</p>

<p>In the course of the week, other officers of the Chatauqua
visited the patient, and at the end of that period
the doctor permitted Somers to be conveyed on board the
Ben Lomond.</p>

<p class="h3">MISS PORTINGTON NOT AT HOME.</p>

<p>Pillgrim and Langdon had been in close confinement
at Pensacola since their capture. They
were now placed on board of the Ben Lomond
to be sent north. An apartment was specially
fitted up for their use in the steerage, for they were
regarded as dangerous men, to whom bolts, bars, and
other obstacles, were but trifling impediments. A sufficient
number of marines to guard them were detailed for
duty on the passage, and the steamer sailed for Boston,
where the prize was to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Somers was now improving very rapidly, and before
he left the hospital, had sat up a small portion of each
day. The pleasant intelligence brought to him by Tom
Longstone had not retarded his recovery; on the contrary,
the bright hopes of the future which it suggested,
rather stimulated his feeble frame, and assisted in his
restoration to health.</p>

<p>The steamer had fine weather on the passage, with the
exception of a gale of thirty hours' duration. She put<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
into Hampton Roads, and landed her prisoners at Fortress
Monroe, in accordance with the orders of her
commander, and then proceeded to Boston. The Ben
Lomond behaved remarkably well in the heavy weather
she experienced, proving herself to be a strongly-built
and substantial vessel. Somers sent his despatches to
Washington from Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>When the Ben Lomond sailed into Boston Harbor,
Somers was able to go on deck, for with each day of the
voyage his health had continued to improve. The
steamer was duly handed over to the naval authorities,
and the young lieutenant was granted a furlough of
sixty days.</p>

<p>"Our cruise is up," said Tom Longstone, when the
business had been completed.</p>

<p>"For the present, we have nothing to do; but I hope
we shall soon receive our orders," replied Somers.
"Now, Tom, you will go down to Pinchbrook with me,
and spend a couple of months."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jack; I hardly think I should know how
to behave in a house on shore, it is so long since I have
been in one."</p>

<p>"You will soon learn."</p>

<p>They went to Pinchbrook, and Tom received a welcome
almost as cordial as that extended to Somers. The
veteran was soon made entirely at home by his young
friend's father, and such a "spinning of yarns" for<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
thirty days had never been known before. Tom told a
story of the Cumberland; then Captain Somers had a
West India yarn; and gran'ther Greene was indulgently
permitted to relate his experience in the "last war,"
though it was observed that the old man, whose memory
was much impaired, always told the same story.</p>

<p>Never did a happier trio gather around a kitchen fire
than that which sat around the cook-stove at Pinchbrook
on those autumn mornings. Very likely Mrs. Somers
thought the "men folks" were in the way at times; but,
she was too much interested in the stories told, and too
good natured to raise an objection, especially when
John joined the party.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Somers was rapidly regaining his
health and strength. As may be supposed, he was a
lion in Pinchbrook, and was invited to every party and
every merry-making in the place. Captain Barney was
with him a great deal, and was as fond of him as though
he had been his own son. Of course the young ladies of
Pinchbrook regarded the lieutenant as a great man; and
if it had not been known in town that he was "paying
attention" to a commodore's daughter, he might have
been absolutely persecuted by the fair ones of his native
village.</p>

<p>In strict observance of his promise, Somers had written
several letters to Kate Portington, but had received no
answer. These epistles, with the exception of an occasional<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
playful remark, were confined to the details of his
naval operations. The events of his career were faithfully
recorded, and they were in no sense such productions
as many silly young men would have written under
similar circumstances. No answer to any of them had
been received.</p>

<p>Since his arrival at Pinchbrook, Somers had written
two letters; but at the end of the first month of his furlough,
he had not heard a word from Kate. He was
troubled, and no doubt thought Kate was very cold and
cruel. He knew that Pillgrim had not seen her, and
therefore could not have prejudiced her against him. It
was possible that his letters had not reached their destination;
Kate might be away from home; and he was
not willing to believe that anything had occurred to make
her less friendly to him than formerly.</p>

<p>Somers, as we have so often had occasion to represent
him, was always in favor of "facing the music." If
there was anything the matter, he wanted to know it.
If the lady wished to discontinue the acquaintance, he
wanted to know that; and when he could no longer content
himself in Pinchbrook, with the question unsettled,
he started for Newport. On his arrival he proceeded at
once to the residence of Commodore Portington. With
a firm hand he rang the bell&mdash;in surprising contrast
with his first visit, for now he was firm and decided.</p>

<p>The servant informed him that Miss Portington was at<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
home, and he sent up his card. Somers sat nervously
waiting the issue. Presently the servant returned and
handed him a card, on which was written, "<i>Miss Portington
is not at home to Mr. John Somers</i>."</p>

<p>He was confounded by this cool reply. Though her
present conduct was in accordance with the unanswered
letters, he had not expected to be thus rudely repelled.
If she had any objection to him, why didn't she tell him
so? He had done his duty to his country, and kept his
promises to her. It was the severest blow he had ever
received.</p>

<p>He read the card, rose from his chair, and left the
house, as dignified as though he had been on the quarter
deck of the Ben Lomond. He was too proud to ask or
to offer any explanations. We will not undertake to say
how bad he felt. Perhaps he wished he had died in the
Pensacola hospital, when he lay at death's door; perhaps
he felt like rushing into the hottest of a fight, and laying
down his life for the cause he had espoused, without
thinking that this would be suicide, rather than a generous
sacrifice to a holy duty.</p>

<p>Mr. Pillgrim had informed him that he would meet
with a "chilly" reception. It was even worse than
that; but as it was evidently caused by the traitor's
machinations, he was content to suffer. If she chose to
let the words of the wretched conspirator against his
country bias her against him, he could not help it; and<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
his only remaining duty was to submit with the best possible
grace.</p>

<p>Of course he could not leave Newport without calling
at the Naval Academy. Mr. Revere, the commandant
of midshipmen, was his firm friend, and it would be
treason to him to leave the city without seeing him. He
was cordially received, and his experience in Mobile Bay
was listened to with the most friendly interest.</p>

<p>"I need not ask you if you have been to Commodore
Portington's," said Mr. Revere.</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, how is Miss Portington?"</p>

<p>"I did not see her," replied Somers, who, conscious
that he had done no wrong, was not disposed to conceal
his misfortune from so good a friend.</p>

<p>"Did not see her!" exclaimed the commandant.</p>

<p>Somers explained.</p>

<p>The story of Pillgrim's treason had been circulated,
but the particulars by which it had been exposed were
known to only a few. Mr. Revere saw at once the cause
of the rupture.</p>

<p>"The villain has sent her the bond you signed,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has."</p>

<p>"Probably she knows nothing of the circumstances
under which you signed it."</p>

<p>"I have had no opportunity to explain."<span class="pagenum">[290]</span></p>

<p>"But, Somers, you musn't be too stiff. Any lady
would be fully justified in refusing to see a gentleman
who signed a paper like that, which contained her name
in such a connection."</p>

<p>"I think so myself; and therefore I will not blame
her."</p>

<p>"Pillgrim got you to sign that document for this
very purpose."</p>

<p>"I surmised as much."</p>

<p>"But it is a wrong to the lady as well as to you, to
permit this thing to go on."</p>

<p>"I have no remedy."</p>

<p>"Write her a note, explaining your position."</p>

<p>"My motives would be misconstrued."</p>

<p>"Then I shall act for you."</p>

<p>Somers went to his hotel, and Mr. Revere did act it for
him. Kate was not satisfied. A high-minded man
would have died rather than sign such a paper. So
would Somers, if the bond had any real meaning. The
commandant was not successful in the negotiation, as
mediators seldom are in such cases.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied, Mr. Revere," said Somers: but he
was as far from satisfied as a young man could be.</p>

<p>"There is no help for it; but, Somers, I have invited
a few friends to my house this evening, and you must be
with us."</p>

<p>"Will Miss Portington be there?"<span class="pagenum">[291]</span></p>

<p>"She has been invited, with her mother."</p>

<p>"I will go," replied he, still carrying out his principle
that it is always best to "face the music."</p>

<p>He did go. The few friends were about fifty&mdash;to
celebrate the birthday of the commandant's lady. There
were music, and dancing, and revelry; and Kate Portington
was there, with her mother. He saw the fair girl;
saw her smile as pleasantly and unconcernedly as though
nothing had happened. He met her face to face; she
bowed coldly, and passed on. Mrs. Portington was not
quite so "chilly," but not at all as she had been in
former times.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, we shall always remember you with
gratitude, for the service you so kindly rendered us,"
said she.</p>

<p>"It is hardly worth remembering, madam, much less
mentioning," replied Somers.</p>

<p>"It shall always be gratefully remembered, and cordially
mentioned. You cannot yourself regret more than
I do, that anything should have occurred to disturb the
pleasant relations which formerly existed."</p>

<p>"I regret it very much, madam; but as I think I
have done my duty to my country and to my friends, I
must regret it without reproaching myself for my conduct
in that which has proved so offensive."</p>

<p>"Was it your duty to sign that vile paper?" asked the
lady, in excited tones.<span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>"I think it was."</p>

<p>"I must take a different view of the matter; but, Mr.
Somers, I shall still be interested in your success."</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam."</p>

<p>And the lady passed on. Somers looked at Kate.
She was dancing with a young officer who had greatly
distinguished himself in the waters of North Carolina.
She looked happy. Was she so? She certainly had a
wonderful command of herself if she was not. Somers
retired at an early hour.</p>

<p>Did Kate think he was an adventurer? His superior
officer had directed him to sign the bond, as a "war
measure." He had done so with regret and disgust.
The paper meant nothing to him. Why should it mean
anything to her and her mother?</p>

<p>The next day, Somers returned to Pinchbrook, where
he found certain official documents in the post office,
directed to him. He was appointed to the command of
the Firefly, which was the new name given by the department
to the Ben Lomond. The steamer had been
duly condemned, and purchased by the government, her
great speed admirably adapting her as a cruiser for rebel
pirates. Somers was generously rewarded for his zeal
and success in the capture of the twin steamers, which
had been intended to prey on the commerce of the
country.</p>

<p>Acting Ensign Longstone was appointed second lieutenant<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
of the Firefly. The third and fourth lieutenants,
and the sailing master, were acting ensigns, like Tom
Longstone.</p>

<p>All was excitement now at the cottage in Pinchbrook,
in anticipation of Somers's departure. A lieutenant commanding
was a higher position than he had ever hoped
to obtain; but even while he rejoiced over his bright
future, he could not help being "blue" over his affair at
Newport. He tried to forget the fair lady, but he found
that was not an easy matter. He devoted himself to the
fitting up of the Firefly, spending part of his time at
Pinchbrook, till his orders came from Washington. A
kind word from Kate would have made him the happiest
man in the world. As that did not come, he went to sea
without it.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE BEN LEDI.</p>

<p>The Firefly had been strengthened and otherwise
improved for the purpose to which she was to be
applied. Her armament had been changed, to
adapt it to the standard of the United States navy.
She now carried a hundred pounder rifle amidships, a
rifled thirty on her forecastle, four twenty-four pounders
on the broadsides, and two howitzers on the quarter
deck. The cabin, ward-room, and steerage remained as
before.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant November day&mdash;in the full reign
of the Indian summer&mdash;when she went down the harbor.
Somers stood on the quarter deck, as dignified as
the commander of a man-of-war should be, but he
could hardly repress the feeling of pride and exultation
with which he regarded his position. He was hardly
twenty-one, though he was mature enough in appearance
and in judgment for twenty-five. He had realized the
warmest hope he had permitted himself to cherish. He
was in command of a beautiful vessel, with a hundred<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
officers and men under his charge. He was the supreme
authority; every man on board touched his cap to him.</p>

<p>Below was a cabin, appropriated wholly to his use,
where he could live as luxuriously as a lord. He had no
watch to keep, no work to perform. As he contemplated
his position, he was absolutely amazed. He had hoped,
but not expected, to reach this pinnacle of his ambition.
But there was another side to the question. A fearful
responsibility was imposed upon him. The lives of his
hundred men depended upon him. This valuable steamer,
with her armament and stores, was intrusted to him,
and he must account for all loss or waste on board of
her. More than this, the honor of the flag under which
he sailed had been committed to him. If he lost his
ship by bad management, it would be his ruin. If he
permitted the ensign which floated at his peak to be disgraced,
it would be infamy to him.</p>

<p>In the public service he might have occasion to run
into foreign ports, or to visit neutral waters. His want
of knowledge, or his want of judgment, might entangle
his country in perplexing broils with other nations, or
even involve her in another war. As he thought of his
delicate and difficult duties, he felt like shrinking from
them, and avoiding the immense responsibility. Being
"captain," in this view, was quite a different thing from
what he had anticipated.</p>

<p>With a smile he recalled his own reflections, when, as<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
an ordinary seaman, he had observed the captain of his
ship walk the deck. Then he had thought the commander
had the easiest and jolliest time of all the men on
board, with his fine cabin all to himself, and no watch to
keep, and apparently no work to do. From his present
stand-point, the captain occupied the most difficult and
trying place in the ship, and he almost wished he had
declined the command offered to him.</p>

<p>Outside the bay, the sealed orders were opened. As
he had anticipated, he was ordered to cruise in search of
rebel steamers, whose depredations on the coast had
severely tried the patience of the nation. He was
directed to proceed first to the eastward, and then to use
his own judgment. There were several rebel privateers,
or naval vessels belonging to the Confederacy. The
Tallahassee, the Chickamauga, and the Olustee had been
the most mischievous; and it was believed that there
were others at Wilmington, and the <i>neutral</i> ports of New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the West Indies.</p>

<p>Having learned where he was to go, and what he was
to do, he went on deck and gave his orders to Mr. Gamage,
the first lieutenant. The Firefly was headed to the
north-east, and all sail set to help her along. Before
Somers went below, she logged fifteen knots, which was
splendid for a ship with her bunkers full of coal.</p>

<p>In the evening the young commander invited Tom
Longstone to visit his cabin. The veteran was in his<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
happiest frame of mind. All the aspirations of his earlier
years seemed to have been rekindled in his soul; he
had abandoned the use of slang, and conducted himself
so much like a gentleman, outwardly, that no one could
have suspected he had spent thirty odd years of his life
before the mast; but as he had always been a gentleman
at heart, it was comparatively easy for him to assume
the externals of his new profession.</p>

<p>The old man had donned a new uniform; and though
his hair and beard were iron gray, he looked as "spruce"
as a dry goods clerk. No change of dress, however,
could make him any other than an "old salt." He
walked with a rolling gait, and had all the airs of a
veteran seaman. It is true that in the transposition
from the forecastle to the ward-room he had discarded
"pigtail," and confined himself to "fine cut," taken
from a silver box; but he still used as much of the
"weed" as an old sheet-anchor man.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, Captain Somers," said the second
lieutenant, as he touched his fore-top, from the force of
habit.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Longstone," said the captain. "It
is one of the blessings of my present position that I have
a place to sit down and talk with old friends. I suppose
you know we are bound to the eastward in search of
rebel privateers."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Gamage told me, sir. I hope we shall catch
some of them."<span class="pagenum">[298]</span></p>

<p>"So do I; but I'm afraid we are on a wild-goose
chase."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not&mdash;at least, I hope not. If there is a
rebel ship in these waters, we'll have her, if we have to
dive after her."</p>

<p>"The ocean is very broad. None of our ships have
had much luck in catching these rebel pirates. I would
rather have gone down on the blockade, where there is
some show for us."</p>

<p>"Don't give it up, Captain Somers."</p>

<p>"I don't give it up; but I do not see any reason why
I should be more fortunate than others. A score of our
ships have cruised for months without catching a single
one of them."</p>

<p>"They didn't look where they were," laughed Tom.</p>

<p>"If I knew where they were, I would look there."</p>

<p>"You will certainly catch one of the pirates, Captain
Somers."</p>

<p>"Why do you say so?"</p>

<p>"Because you are smart, and you are lucky. I know
you will make a capture on this cruise. I feel it in my
bones."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall. Wouldn't it be glorious, if I could
send such a despatch as Captain Winslow did, after he
had sunk the Alabama?"</p>

<p>Somers's eyes glistened as he thought of it, but it was
only an air-castle; and after he had contemplated it for<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
a moment, his common sense obliged him to come down
from the clouds.</p>

<p>The cruise of the Firefly would supply matter enough
for a whole volume, but we have only space for a mere
outline of the voyage. The steamer lay off and on for a
week without meeting with anything that looked like a
rebel privateer, when her commander decided to run into
Halifax, where he hoped to obtain some information.
The city was a nest of "secesh sympathizers," and the
captain of the Firefly was not received with much enthusiasm
outside of the American consulate. He had
not been in the habit of hearing his country and her
rulers vilified, and as he sat in the parlor of the hotel,
and listened to hostile remarks, evidently intended for
his ear, nothing but prudence prevented him from indulging
in the luxury of pulling the noses of the speakers.
He preserved his dignity in spite of his inclination.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, this is a very unexpected pleasure,"
said a familiar voice.</p>

<p>He looked up from the newspaper he was reading.
Before him stood Mr. Pillgrim!</p>

<p>"Quite as unexpected to me as to you, Mr. Pillgrim!"
replied Somers, with abundant self-possession.</p>

<p>"I dare say, Mr. Somers," laughed Pillgrim. "Of
course you did not expect to see me. Will you take a
glass of wine with me, Mr. Somers?"</p>

<p>"No, I thank you; I never indulge&mdash;as you are
aware."<span class="pagenum">[300]</span></p>

<p>"I didn't know but your rapid advancement had
changed your tastes."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You command the Ben Lomond now, Mr. Somers, I
learn from the papers."</p>

<p>"The Firefly is her present name."</p>

<p>"Bah! What an ugly name for a fine steamer like
her. The Tallapoosa is much better. Be that as it
may, I congratulate you on your promotion and your
appointment; and you know how sincere I am!</p>

<p>"I do know; and, therefore, cannot even thank you
for your good wishes."</p>

<p>"Don't be savage, Mr. Somers. You can afford to
be very good-natured."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be very glad to see me."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am. I hope, with your usual
candor, that you will tell me what you are going to do
next, and give me an opportunity to cut out your vessel.
I am up here for that purpose."</p>

<p>Pillgrim bit his lip.</p>

<p>"At present, Mr. Somers, I must be silent; but we
shall yet meet and settle up old accounts. Let us not be
ill-natured. If we meet as enemies, we will fight it out."</p>

<p>"We can never meet in any other way."</p>

<p>"That isn't friendly. How is Miss Portington?"</p>

<p>"She was well, last time I saw her;" and Somers
blushed, and looked disconcerted&mdash;as he really was.<span class="pagenum">[301]</span></p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, Mr. Somers," said Pillgrim,
significantly.</p>

<p>Somers changed the topic at once, and finally contrived
to ask the traitor how he happened to be in Halifax,
instead of Fortress Monroe. Pillgrim laughed exultingly,
and declared there were no irons, bolts, or bars
that could keep him a prisoner; and the facts seemed to
justify the assertion.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, not more than one half of the people
of the North are in favor of this cruel war. I have
friends in Washington and other cities whom no one
suspects of favoring the South. I am indebted to them
for my liberation. I shall yet carry out my original purpose.
I have lost three vessels. I was paid for two by
the Confederacy; and I have your bond for half the
value of the third. I am a commander in the Confederate
navy. In one week I shall be at sea. I shall
sink, burn, and destroy! You can't help yourself."</p>

<p>"Is your ship here?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no."</p>

<p>Pillgrim laughed, turned on his heel, and walked
away. Somers was excited. He wanted to know more.
He went to the American consul. A "blue-nose" sailor
of the Firefly was sent on shore, who found Pillgrim,
and without much difficulty shipped in the "Sunny
South" for a voyage on the coast. This was all the
information that could be obtained. There was no such<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
craft as the Sunny South in port. Somers examined all
the vessels in the harbor, and found a steamer called the
Ben Ledi&mdash;another Scottish mountain. She was Clyde-built,
and similar to the Ben Nevis and the Ben Lomond.
The name alone satisfied the inquirer that she belonged
to the same family as the two vessels he had already
captured.</p>

<p>Things began to look a little more hopeful, and the
young commander carefully read his books on international
law. He attempted to place the Firefly where he
could watch the suspected steamer; but the authorities,
on various pretences, prevented him from doing so. The
next morning the Ben Ledi was gone. Somers was exceedingly
mortified, for he might as well look for a needle
in a haymow as try to find the vessel on the ocean. He
put to sea at once. A "blue-nose" official laughed at
him as his gig pulled off to the ship, and everybody on
shore was in high glee because the Confederate had
eluded the Yankee.</p>

<p>Somers kept cool in spite of his chagrin; and believing
the Ben Ledi would run for Wilmington, where she
would probably be fitted out as a cruiser, he headed the
Firefly in that direction, and gave chase.</p>

<hr class="chapter" />

<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="h3">A LONG CHASE.</p>

<p>Somers was somewhat bewildered by the events
which had transpired during his brief stay at
Halifax. It was almost incredible that Pillgrim
had again escaped; but the traitor had powerful friends&mdash;men
who appeared to be loyal while they were in full
sympathy with the leaders of the rebellion. The three
"Bens," the last of which was now fleeing before him,
were certainly an interesting family. Pillgrim, while
abroad, and operating for the Southern Confederacy, had
apparently purchased a whole line of Clyde-built steamers.
Two of them were now in good hands, and doing
good service to the loyal cause; but Somers feared that
the third would escape him.</p>

<p>Pillgrim had learned prudence from the experience of
the past. Somers hoped he would indulge in his customary
reckless boasting; that his thirst for revenge would
again lead him to betray himself; but he had not dropped
even a hint that could be of any service. The decoy
seaman had only learned that he was to sail in the<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
"Sunny South." The sudden departure of the Ben
Ledi was the only important fact in possession of the
commander of the Firefly.</p>

<p>When the ship was well out of the bay, and her course
laid down, Somers went into his cabin to consult his
charts, and consider a plan for future operations. Unfortunately
there was no information on which to base a
theory in regard to the pirate's course. He could only
guess at her destination. The Firefly was run at her
best speed during the rest of the day, but her course
for a large portion of the time was through a dense
Nova Scotia fog, and nothing was seen or heard.</p>

<p>On the following day, the sun shone through a clear
air, and at noon there was seen, dead ahead, some evidences
of black smoke in the horizon. This was a hopeful
sign, for there was a steamer burning English coal in
the direction indicated. It might be the Ben Ledi, and
it might not; but the appearance created a tremendous
excitement on board the Firefly.</p>

<p>"Captain Somers, you will have her," said Tom Longstone,
placing himself by the side of the young commander.
"It is your luck."</p>

<p>"That may not be the steamer we are after. We
haven't seen her yet."</p>

<p>"That's the Ben Ledi; you may depend upon it. I
wouldn't give five cents to any man to guarantee my
share of prize money in her."<span class="pagenum">[305]</span></p>

<p>"Don't be too confident, Mr. Longstone."</p>

<p>"She is ours, Captain Somers."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe it."</p>

<p>"You must believe it, and work for it."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly work for it."</p>

<p>And he did work for it. Everything that would add a
fraction of a knot to the speed of the Firefly was done.
The black smoke was visible all the rest of the day, but
not a sight of the steamer from which it proceeded could
be obtained. Darkness settled down upon the ocean,
and nothing could be seen during the night. The next
day was cloudy, and there was not a sign of encouragement
to those on board of the pursuing vessel. Then
came a gale of twenty hours' duration; but the Firefly
held her course, and proved herself to be a perfect sea
boat.</p>

<p>The fourth day out from Halifax was fine, and shortly
after sunrise the cloud of black smoke was again discovered,
and a thrill of delight coursed through the
veins of Somers as he discovered it. The steamer was
on the port bow now, but it was evident that both steamers
were bound to the same point, though their courses
had slightly varied during the gale.</p>

<p>"I told you so, Captain Somers!" exclaimed Lieutenant
Longstone, as he rubbed his hands briskly in view of
the bright prospect.</p>

<p>"We haven't caught her yet, Mr. Longstone."<span class="pagenum">[306]</span></p>

<p>"But you will catch her, just as sure as the sun
shines."</p>

<p>"Mr. Pillgrim will not allow himself to be taken."</p>

<p>"He cannot help himself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he can. That steamer sails as well as the
Firefly, and we are not a hundred and fifty miles from
Cape Fear."</p>

<p>"No matter; we have got ten hours' working time,
and we shall use her up. Shall we put the helm to starboard,
Captain Somers?"</p>

<p>"No; keep her as she is," replied the commander.
"If she is going into Wilmington we shall be making
something on this tack. We have the weather-gage of
her."</p>

<p>It was soon clearly demonstrated that the chase had
"slowed down," so as not to approach the coast before
night should favor her operations, though her great speed
gave her every advantage over an ordinary pursuer.
The Firefly had run down so that the Ben Ledi was on
her port beam, about eight miles distant. Both steamers
had hoisted English colors, for Somers had no idea
of being cheated out of the game by "showing his
hand."</p>

<p>The most intense excitement prevailed on board of the
Firefly, for it was evident that a few hours more would
settle the question one way or the other. Somers was
not disposed to wait until night, which would favor the<span class="pagenum">[307]</span>
chase more than himself; and he was afraid, if he headed
towards her, that she would take the alarm and beat him
on time. He kept quiet for a couple of hours, just as
though he were waiting for the darkness to cover him in
running the blockade.</p>

<p>His plan seemed to be a success, for after a while the
Ben Ledi began to bear down upon him. It was an
anxious hour for Somers. He ordered the first lieutenant
to beat to quarters, and the chief engineer to have
on a full head of steam. The guns were loaded with
solid shot, and every preparation made for an exciting
time. Pillgrim did not seem to suspect thus far that the
steamer under English colors was the one he had left in
Halifax harbor. It was certain that he did not yet
recognize her.</p>

<p>The Firefly reciprocated the attention of the Ben Ledi,
and moved slowly towards her, for Somers was careful
not to excite suspicion by being precipitate. The two
steamers approached within three miles, and the respective
captains were busy in examining each other's ship
through their glasses. The chase now hoisted her number.
As Somers had the Lloyd's signal book, he read it
without difficulty. It was the Ben Ledi. To the question,
"What ship is that?" he had no answer to give,
for it was not prudent to hoist the old number of the
Ben Lomond.</p>

<p>Our younger readers may not understand how a conversation<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
is carried on between ships at sea, several miles
distant from each other. There are ten small signal flags
representing the nine digits and the zero. Any number
can of course be formed of these figures. Every ship is
provided with a number, which if it consists of two
figures is represented by two flags, hoisted together;
three figures, three flags; and so on.</p>

<p>The signal book also contains a great number of questions
and answers, such as, "What ship is that?"
"Where bound?" "All well." "Short of water," &amp;c.
Each sentence has its invariable number, which may be
indicated by the signal flags. If one vessel shows the
number 124, the captain of the ship signalized would find
this number in his signal book; and against it would be
printed the question or answer.</p>

<p>Somers was not disposed to reply to the question of
Pillgrim; and as he did not do so, the traitor immediately
took the alarm. The Ben Ledi went about, and made
off to the eastward under full steam. The Firefly was
all ready to follow, and then commenced a most exciting
chase. It was useless to waste shot at that distance, and
Somers confined his attention to the speed of his vessel.
For three hours the pursuit was continued, without any
perceptible decrease of the distance between the two
steamers.</p>

<p>But it was soon discovered that Pillgrim was gradually
wearing round. Somers perceived his intention, but it<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
was not prudent to attempt to cut him off all at once, by
taking the arc of a smaller circle; but he worked his
ship slowly round; and when both vessels were headed
to the west, he had gained a mile. Pillgrim had evidently
made up his mind to go into Wilmington at any
risk, though under ordinary circumstances the more prudent
course would have been for him to continue at sea,
where a dark night or a fog might have enabled him to
elude his pursuer. Somers concluded, therefore, that the
Ben Ledi was short of coal, for his own supply was
nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>The furnaces of the Firefly were now worked to their
utmost capacity, and every expedient to make steam was
resorted to by the excited engineers and firemen. There
was a stiff breeze from the south-west, and both vessels
had crowded on every stitch of canvas that could be
spread. It had already been demonstrated that there
was no appreciable difference in the speed of the two
steamers, and the result of the chase was to depend entirely
upon the management of each.</p>

<p>When the two vessels had come about so as to make a
fair wind, the Firefly had been the first to spread her
canvas, and the superior discipline of her crew was thus
made apparent. A slight advantage had thus been
gained, and it was certain that "the balance of power" lay
in the sails. At meridian an observation was obtained,
and the position of the ship was accurately laid down on<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
the chart. The latitude was 33&deg; 59' 7"; the longitude
76&deg; 29' 23". To make the Swash Channel, which was
covered by the guns of Fort Fisher, the Ben Ledi would
have laid a course about half a point south of west; but
her present course was west-south-west. Somers, after
examining his chart, had some doubts whether she was
going into Wilmington.</p>

<p>Tom Longstone had the deck during the afternoon
watch. He was a veteran seaman, and his experience
had made him more familiar with canvas than with
steam. With the most anxious solicitude he watched
the sails during the afternoon, and under his skilful
directions they were kept perfectly trimmed. On that
momentous occasion everything was reduced down to
the finest point, as well in the handling of the engine as
the tacks, sheets, and halliards.</p>

<p>The case was hopeful, though the gain could not be
perceived in one, or two, hours; but at eight bells hardly
a mile lay between the contending steamers. The first
lieutenant wanted to open on the chase with the rifled
gun on the top-gallant forecastle; but Somers refused permission,
for while he was gaining on the Ben Ledi only
in inches, he could not afford to lose feet by the recoil of
the gun, until there was a better chance of hitting the
mark. At two bells in the first dog watch, just as the
sun was setting, the Ben Ledi doubled Frying Pan
Shoals, passing close to the breakers. Then, as her<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
people discovered a couple of vessels belonging to
the blockading squadron, she sheered off, and went to
the westward.</p>

<p>These changes, with the doubt and uncertainty which
prevailed on board of the Ben Ledi, had been very favorable
to the Firefly, now within half a mile of her. Two
vessels from the blockading fleet had started to engage in
the exciting work, but they were too late to help or
hinder the pursuit. Somers gave the order to fire upon
the Ben Ledi, which was now endeavoring to work round
to the Beach Channel.</p>

<p>Though the darkness had settled down upon the chase,
the Firefly continued the pursuit with unabated vigor.
Her pilot was familiar with the channels, bars, and
shoals. Shot after shot was fired at the Ben Ledi, and
it was soon evident that one of them had in some way
damaged her wheels, for she was rapidly losing ground.
But now a battery on Oak Island suddenly opened on the
Firefly.</p>

<p>"We must end this thing," said Somers, as a shot
from the fort whizzed over his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the first lieutenant. "We can
hardly pass that battery."</p>

<p>"Try the hundred pounder."</p>

<p>When the pivot gun was ready, the Firefly swung
round, and the heavy piece roared out its salutation to
the blockade runner. It was aimed by Tom Longstone,<span class="pagenum">[312]</span>
and the bolt struck the Ben Ledi square in the stern,
breaking in her counter, and leaving her helpless on the
water. The Firefly stopped her wheels. A shot from
the fort crushed through her smoke-stack.</p>

<p>The chase, completely disabled, drifted on the beach
and grounded, under the guns of the battery. The Firefly
now poured shell into her from every gun that could
be brought to bear. In a few moments a sheet of flame
rose from her, and lighted up the channel for miles
around, clearly revealing to the gunners in the fort the
exact position of Somers's vessel.</p>

<p>The work had been accomplished, the Ben Ledi had
been destroyed, and the Firefly hastened to escape from
her dangerous locality. In coming about she poured a
parting broadside into the burning steamer. As she
swung round, a hail from the water was heard, and a
boat containing several men was discovered. It had
been carried by the tide away from the beach. The
occupants were taken on board, though one of them was
wounded and utterly helpless. They had no oars, and
were in danger of being carried out to sea.</p>

<p>"Here's the cap'n; he was hit by a piece of a shell,"
said one of the men.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Somers.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Pillgrim."</p>

<p>The sufferer was taken down into the ward-room, and
the surgeon began to examine him as the Firefly steamed<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
down the channel under a shower of shot and shell from
the battery.</p>

<p>"How is he?" asked the young commander, when the
ship had passed out of the reach of the guns of the fort.</p>

<p>"He is dead!" replied the surgeon.</p>

<p>"Dead! Good Heaven!" exclaimed Somers, impressed
by the terrible retribution which had at last
overtaken the traitor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he died a few moments since. A fragment
of a shell tore open his breast and penetrated his lungs,"
added the surgeon.</p>

<p>"That's the last of him," said Lieutenant Longstone.
"He will lay no more plots."</p>

<p>"He has been a dangerous enemy to his country,"
continued Somers. "If he had succeeded in running in
with that vessel, he would have obtained her armament,
and made terrible havoc among the merchant ships on
the coast. He was a daring fellow; he was reckless at
times. He told me on board of the Chatauqua that he
had purchased three steamers in Scotland; this is the
last one."</p>

<p>"Three Bens," added Tom. "Captain Somers, you
have had a hand in capturing and destroying them all."</p>

<p>"I have; and it is really marvellous, when I think
of it."</p>

<p>"I knew you would capture the Ben Ledi," continued
the second lieutenant, exultingly.<span class="pagenum">[314]</span></p>

<p>"I did not capture her."</p>

<p>"It is the same thing."</p>

<p>"You will not find it so when your prize money is
distributed."</p>

<p>"A fig for the prize money," replied Tom, contemptuously.
"We destroyed her; and it's all the same thing.
I would rather have had that villain hanged than killed
by an honest shell; but there is no help for it now."</p>

<p>"Peace, Mr. Longstone; he is dead now. We have
nothing more to do with him."</p>

<p>The body of Mr. Pillgrim was laid out in a proper
place, and as the coal bunkers of the Firefly were nearly
empty, she was headed for Port Royal, where she arrived
on the afternoon of the following day. On the passage,
the men from the Ben Ledi, who had been picked up in
the boat, were examined in regard to their knowledge of
her ultimate use. One of the party was an intelligent
English seaman, who acknowledged that he had shipped,
for the Confederate navy, in the Sunny South, which
was to be the new name of the Ben Ledi. She had
waited a month at Halifax for orders. Langdon was not
on board of her, and the seaman had no knowledge of
any such person.</p>

<p>The Firefly had not been seen on board the Sunny
South until both steamers were off Wilmington. After
passing Frying Pan Shoals, a shot from the Firefly had
partially crippled her port wheel, which accident had<span class="pagenum">[315]</span>
caused her to lose ground rapidly. The projectile from
the hundred pounder had completely shattered her stern,
and disabled her rudder, and knocked the engine "all in
a heap." The port quarter boat was torn to pieces by a
shell, the same which had given Pillgrim his mortal
wound. The after tackle of the other quarter boat had
been shot away, and when it was dropped into the water
the oars were gone. Most of the crew had saved themselves
by swimming ashore. The Ben Ledi had a valuable
cargo, which the informer declared was totally destroyed
by fire or water.</p>

<p>On her arrival at Port Royal, the Firefly coaled without
delay; the body of Pillgrim was buried, and after
forwarding his despatches to the navy department by a
supply steamer, Somers sailed again on another cruise
after privateers, Confederate cruisers, and blockade runners.
The Tallahassee and the Chickamauga were supposed
to be at Wilmington, but the Olustee was believed
to be still afloat. Of this cruise our limits do not permit
us to record details; but the Firefly captured a valuable
steamer in December, and sent her into port. This was
the only prize she obtained; and being short of coal, she
ran into Boston, on New Year's day, where her prize
had arrived before her.</p>

<p>Somers immediately forwarded his despatches, and
awaited the orders of the department. Of course he
hastened down to Pinchbrook as soon as he could leave<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
the ship, where he was heartily welcomed and warmly
congratulated upon his successful cruise.</p>

<p>"Here's something for you, John," said Mrs. Somers,
taking a daintily made up letter from the mantel-piece,
when the welcome had been given, kisses bestowed, and
hands shaken. "It has been here a fortnight."</p>

<p>Somers knew the handwriting, for it had often gladdened
his heart before, and a flush came to his cheeks as
he tore open the envelope. It was from Kate Portington,
whom the young commander had not failed to think of
every day during his absence, though it was with pain
and sorrow at the rupture which had separated them.
The letter healed his only wound.</p>

<p>"I shall never forgive myself," she wrote, "for my
harsh treatment of you; and I am afraid you can never
forgive me. I have seen Mr. Hackleford, who says that
he <i>ordered</i> you to sign that horrible paper. Why didn't
you tell me so, John?" He would have told her so, if
she had given him an opportunity. But she was repentant,
and Somers was rejoiced.</p>

<p>The letter was four pages in length, and among all the
pleasant things it contained, the pleasantest was that she
was spending a month in Boston, at the residence of a
friend, where she hoped to see him.</p>

<p>She did see him there, on the very day he received the
letter. What passed between them we are not at liberty
to say in a book of this kind, except to inform the reader<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
that Kate was herself again; that in the joy of meeting
him after this painful rupture, she actually forgot to
be proper, and in spite of her promise, and her mother's
lecture, she called him "prodigy." The past, the
present, and the future, were discussed, and Somers went
on board the Firefly the happiest of mortals.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="h3">THE END OF THE REBELLION.</p>

<p>The Firefly, with her energetic young commander,
was too serviceable to be permitted long to remain
in idleness, and she was ordered to join
Admiral Porter's squadron, which had failed to capture
Fort Fisher in December; or rather, the military portion
of the expedition had failed to do it, for the navy had
done its part of the work to the satisfaction of the nation.</p>

<p>Somers sailed again, and in due time reported to the
admiral, who was then waiting for the army, in order to
make the second attack. A tremendous gale delayed the
expedition; but on the 13th of January, the bombardment
of Fort Fisher was commenced, and the military
force was landed on Federal Point. A detachment of
sailors from the Firefly, under the command of Lieutenant
Longstone, was sent on shore to join the naval
brigade, and the steamer was variously employed during
the action, rendering valuable aid with her hundred
pounder, as well as performing various duties, for which
her great speed and light draught peculiarly fitted her.<span class="pagenum">[319]</span>
The zeal and energy of Somers were warmly commended,
though he had no opportunity to render any signal service
in the attack.</p>

<p>Fort Fisher fell this time; every man and every ship
was faithful; and though some were distinguished by
gallant exploits, the victory was the result of the steadiness
of the whole line, rather than of the brilliant deeds
of the few. The last maritime stronghold of the rebellion
was reduced, and the sinking Confederacy was shut
in from all material support from abroad. Its days were
numbered, and many of its most rabid supporters were
now crying out for peace.</p>

<p>The flag of the Union floated over Fort Fisher, and
the great fleet before its shattered ramparts celebrated
the victory with clouds of gay flags, with flights of rockets,
and with salvos of artillery. It was a glorious day
for that expedition. Admiral Porter and General Terry
won a glorious fame and an unfading name upon the
annals of their country.</p>

<p>Gallant old Tom Longstone was wounded in the arm
in an attempt to rally the sailors when they broke under
the most terrible fire that mortal men ever breasted.
Lieutenant Longstone did all that any officer could do,
but the whole garrison seemed to be gathered at the
point where the naval assault was made. The sailors
were repulsed and driven back. They had never been
disciplined to this kind of work; yet they fought like<span class="pagenum">[320]</span>
tigers, hand to hand oftentimes, with the foe; and
though they were forced back, even while the American
flag was floating over the other side of the works, it was
no disgrace to them. Tom stood by to the last, though
he was severely wounded, and finally had the satisfaction
of beholding a complete triumph. The soldiers did wonders
on that day&mdash;the sailors hardly less.</p>

<p>With other vessels of light draught the Firefly went
up the river, fishing up torpedoes, transporting soldiers,
and hammering down rebel batteries, and continued upon
this duty until General Terry marched into the deserted
city of Wilmington, and raised the national flag where
the emblem of treason had insulted the free air for four
long years.</p>

<p>The Firefly was ordered to the James River, in the
vicinity of which the last groan of the expiring monster
of Rebellion was soon to be heard; and on the 20th of
March she was on her winding way up the stream. In
the mean time Charleston had fallen; negro troops patrolled
her streets, and the people of this foul nest of
secession were suffering the agonies of actual subjugation.
Sherman, with his grand army, was "marching
on" in his resistless course, with hardly a foe to impede
his exultant march. Columbia, the proud capital of
arrogant South Carolina, yielded, and the people repented
their folly in the ashes of the burning city.
Johnston was retreating before his invincible conqueror,<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
and the whole military power of the rebellion east of
Mississippi was concentrated within an area of not more
than a hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>The movements of General Grant before Petersburg
commenced; and his great army, now animated by the
sure prestige of victory, was hurled against the rebel lines.
The shock was tremendous; the whole world seemed
to be shaken by it, for it was the onslaught of freedom,
striking its last terrible blow at the legions of slavery.</p>

<p>The fleet on the James was busily employed in fishing
up torpedoes, in guarding the pontoons across the river,
and in "neutralizing" the enemy's iron-clads which lay
above the obstructions. The Firefly found abundant occupation,
though there was no opportunity for brilliant
and startling achievements; but she bore her full share
in the hard work and disagreeable drudgery of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Tom Longstone had entirely recovered from his
wound; and being a practical man himself, he was the
life of every working party sent out from the ship. The
old man was an immense favorite with the sailors; for,
unlike many who have risen from a low position to a
high, he was kind and considerate, while he exacted the
full measure of duty from all. He was no tyrant, and
had a heart for every man, whatever his degree.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Longstone, we have got almost to the end
of the rebellion," said Captain Somers, on one of those<span class="pagenum">[322]</span>
last days of March, when the roar from beyond Petersburg
was heavier than usual.</p>

<p>"No doubt of that, captain," replied Tom. "I shall
be a boatswain again before long."</p>

<p>"Do you dread the time?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; far be it from me. I wouldn't prolong the
war a single day, if that day would make me an admiral."</p>

<p>"Only one day, Tom?" said Somers, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Not one, sir!" repeated the veteran, with emphasis.
"For on that day a husband or a father, a brother or
a son, might be killed, and I should be a murderer before
God."</p>

<p>"What do you think of those, then, that began this
war?"</p>

<p>"They are murderers! The blood of every man
who has been killed in this war on both sides rests on
their heads. I'd rather be Cain than Jeff Davis, or any
other man of his crew."</p>

<p>"I think you are right, Tom."</p>

<p>"As for me, it don't make much difference whether
I'm a boatswain or an admiral. This old hulk won't
stand many more storms; and I wouldn't do a mean
thing for the sake of living twenty years. Well, well,"
sighed the veteran, as he glanced in the direction from
which the roar of the artillery came, "many a good fellow
will lose the number of his mess to-day."</p>

<p>"Hundreds of them."<span class="pagenum">[323]</span></p>

<p>And so the reports of the succeeding days assured
them. The rebels had stormed and temporarily possessed
themselves of Fort Steadman. The terrible conflict
was opened in earnest; and from that time, swarms
of prisoners were sent forward to the river, which were
guarded by detachments of sailors and marines from the
fleet.</p>

<p>For three days the storm of war continued to howl in
the distance, and on the peaceful Sabbath more fiercely
than before. Vague rumors were flying through the
fleet, and everybody felt that the end was at hand.
Somers retired as usual that night; but in the first
watch, Tom Longstone came down to him with report
of great lights and heavy explosions in the direction of
Richmond.</p>

<p>The rebels were evacuating the city, blowing up their
iron-clads, and firing the town. Richmond, which had
defied the armies of the Union for four years, had fallen.
The heroic and persevering Grant had struck a blow
miles away, which tumbled down the last stronghold of
treason. Jeff Davis and his cabinet were fugitives now,
fleeing from men, while the wrath of God pursued where
men could not reach them.</p>

<p>The morning came, and with it the glad tidings of
victory, which foreshadowed peace. The Firefly was
ordered to move up the river, and she went up into
waters where a loyal steamer had not floated for four<span class="pagenum">[324]</span>
years. The negro troops were even then marching
through the streets of Richmond. The note of rejoicing,
begun in the early morning, was continued through the
day. The brightest flags and the heaviest guns proclaimed
the joyful event.</p>

<p>The Firefly went up to Varina, and then returned.
This river was clear; there was no sign of an enemy
upon its waters. At City Point the sounds of rejoicing
thrilled upon the ear of soldier and sailor. Cheer upon
cheer rent the air, gun upon gun roared the p&aelig;an of
triumph, and every heart beat in unison with the glad
acclaim.</p>

<p>"Glory, hallelujah!" shouted Somers, on the quarter
deck of the Firefly, as she passed through the fleet.</p>

<p>"Glory, hallelujah!" returned all who heard him.</p>

<p>Three rousing cheers, such as Jack only can give,
came from the flag-ship, as the Firefly ran under her
counter.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Somers&mdash;for there seemed to
be something unusual going on.</p>

<p>Calling his gig, he went on board the flag-ship to
report the result of his visit up the river. On the
quarter deck he discovered a familiar face, which thrilled
his heart with delight. It was "Brave Old Salt."</p>

<p>Somers approached the vice admiral, cap in hand, and
was immediately recognized.</p>

<p>"Mr. Somers, I am delighted to see you!" said the
admiral, extending his hand.<span class="pagenum">[325]</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the young commander.
"This is an unexpected happiness to me."</p>

<p>"There is only one joy to-day, Mr. Somers," continued
the admiral. "Richmond has fallen, and the
rebellion is ended!"</p>

<p>"Glory, hallelujah!" said Somers, waving his cap.</p>

<p>"I came down here to learn what Grant was doing.
God bless him! He has done everything," added the
admiral.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Porter now ordered the Firefly to be
placed at the disposal of the Old Salamander, and
Somers was happy in the duty assigned to him. A
twelve-oar barge received the vice admiral, and conveyed
him to the steamer in which his voyage was to be
continued. When he was on board, the barge was
towed astern for his use farther up the river.</p>

<p>The Firefly steamed up the river with her illustrious
passenger, and at the invitation of the admiral, Somers
accompanied him to Richmond.</p>

<p>A day later came President Lincoln in a barge, attended
by Admiral Porter, and Somers had the honor of
being formally presented to the chief magistrate of the
nation, who had a pleasant word for him, as he had for
all who approached him. Somers assisted in the ovation
to the president, and listened with wonder and delight to
the shouts of the negroes, as they greeted the author of<span class="pagenum">[326]</span>
the Emancipation Proclamation as the saviour and
redeemer of their race.</p>

<p>Ten days later, that simple, great man fell by the hand
of the assassin, though not till the news of the surrender
of Lee's army had gladdened his heart, and assured him
that the great work of his lifetime was finished.</p>

<p>Somers was shocked, stunned by the fearful news, the
more so that he had so recently pressed the hand of the
illustrious martyr; and though the nation was full of
mourners, there were none more sincere in their grief than
the young commander of the Firefly. He wept as he
would have wept for his own father; and shutting himself
up in his cabin, in solemn fast, he read his Bible and
prayed for the land he loved. How many true souls did
the same, when they heard of the awful tragedy!</p>

<p>The war was ended. A few days later came the news
of Johnston's surrender. One by one, the gunboats were
ordered north, and in June the Firefly dropped her
anchor off the navy yard at Charlestown. A few hours
later Somers was in the arms of the loved ones at home,
weeping tears of joy that the sound of strife was no more
heard in the land.</p>

<p>The Firefly was no longer needed in the navy, and
with a hundred others she was sold. As soon as she
went out of commission, Tom Longstone, having been
"honorably discharged with the thanks of the department"
as an ensign, returned to his former rank of boatswain.<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>
When he obtained a furlough, he paid a visit to
Pinchbrook, where he was kindly received by all the
friends of his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>. The old man had money enough
to buy him a farm and retire from the navy; but he
obstinately refused to do so while Somers retained his
commission. He confidently expected to be appointed
boatswain of the ship to which Lieutenant Somers might
be ordered.</p>

<p>During his absence Somers had received occasional
letters from Kate Portington; and we will not undertake
to say how many reams of fine note paper he spoiled in
saying what can be of interest to none but the parties
concerned. Of course there was any quantity of liquid
moonshine spread out on these dainty sheets, and the
young man was all the happier for writing it, as she was
for reading it, for Kate and Somers had come to an excellent
understanding with each other on these matters.</p>

<p>At the earliest day the public service would admit, he
hastened to Newport; but on his arrival he found the
commodore's house filled with grief and lamentation.
The husband and the father&mdash;the kindest of husbands and
the tenderest of fathers&mdash;had been suddenly stricken
down in New Orleans, where his ship was stationed.
The sad tidings had come but a few hours before; and a
few hours later it had flashed all over the land that one
of the nation's truest defenders had fallen at the post of
duty.<span class="pagenum">[328]</span></p>

<p>In her grief Kate clung to Somers, who became the
tenderest of comforters. Then she learned, when earth
was dark to her, what a wealth of holy hope and pious
faith there was in the soul of him she had chosen from
the whole world to lean upon in joy and in sorrow, in
prosperity and adversity, till life's fitful dream was over.
Fondly she looked up to him in her heavy affliction, and
through him to the heaven of which he spoke. He wept
with her for him who was gone, and if she had loved
him before, she reverenced him now.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the news came a steamer bearing the
remains of the deceased commodore. Then the tears
broke out afresh, and Somers continued to perform the
holy office he had chosen. With the bereaved child&mdash;the
only one&mdash;he stood at the tomb, and helped her to
see the glory that streamed forth beyond its dark portals.
Every day, for weeks after, he visited her, never now to
speak of his own selfish heart yearnings, but to utter
words of peace and hope. When he announced his
intention to return home, she could not restrain her tears,
so needful had he become to her in the depth of her
sorrow.</p>

<p>In the autumn her mother and herself came to Boston
to spend the winter. Kate was cheerful now, but the
affliction through which she had passed had given a shade
of pensive sadness to her beautiful face, which time alone
could wear away. They attended the wedding of Major<span class="pagenum">[329]</span>
Somers, John's brother, and rejoiced with him as he put
the cup of bliss to his lips. Lilian and Kate became fast
friends; they were nearer alike now than before the
death of Commodore Portington.</p>

<p>The winter passed away, and early in March Lieutenant
Somers was appointed to a ship bound to the
Pacific Ocean. He must be absent two or three years.
He hastened to Kate with the intelligence; and sad as it
was to himself, he knew it would be infinitely more so to
her. She turned pale, and burst into tears. Her mother
was hardly less affected.</p>

<p>"You must not go, John! O, no! You will not
leave me!"</p>

<p>"I must obey orders."</p>

<p>"You can resign," suggested Mrs. Portington.</p>

<p>"Resign!" exclaimed Somers. "Resign when I am
ordered to difficult or disagreeable duty."</p>

<p>"You need not make so much of it," added the
matron, with a smile. "There are twice as many officers
in the navy as are required. It is certainly no disgrace,
in time of peace, to resign. You will only make
a place for another who wants to visit the Pacific."</p>

<p>"You must resign, John," pleaded Kate, with an
eloquence which he could not resist.</p>

<p>"On one condition I will do so," replied he, at last.
"If there should be war, I shall return to my post, if
needed."<span class="pagenum">[330]</span></p>

<p>And thus it was that Somers left the navy. His prize
money, which had been carefully invested from time to
time by Captain Barney, now amounted to more than
twenty thousand dollars. He was able to retire, and he
did so.</p>

<p>It is generally understood that they are to be married
in the autumn, when Mr. Somers will receive half a million
with his wife, who is worth a million times that sum
herself. As the happy event has not yet occurred, we
have nothing to say about it, but we wish them every joy
in anticipation. Mrs. Portington speaks hopefully of the
occasion, and has already selected a location, in the
vicinity of Boston, where the happy young couple are to
reside.</p>

<p>This event has decided Tom Longstone. He has
thrown up his warrant, and bought a farm in Pinchbrook,
on which he intends to "lay up" for the rest of his life.
A niece, who lost her husband in the war, is his housekeeper,
and at the time of Somers's last visit, the veteran
was at the high tide of felicity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With many regrets we bid adieu to John Somers, to
Thomas his brother, and all of the family. We leave
them prosperous and happy; but they have purchased
earth's joys and heaven's hopes by being faithful to duty&mdash;true
to God and themselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Genius comes in with 'Little Prudy.' Compared with her, all other
book-children are cold creations of Literature only; she alone is the real
thing. All the quaintness of childhood, its originality, its tenderness and
its teasing,&mdash;its infinite, unconscious drollery, the serious earnestness of
its fun, the fun of its seriousness, the natural religion of its plays, and the
delicious oddity of its prayers,&mdash;all these waited for dear Little Prudy to
embody them. Sam Weller is not more piquant; Hans Andersen's nutcrackers
and knitting-needles are not more thoroughly charged with life.
Who is our benefactress in the authorship of these books the world knows
not. Sophie May must doubtless be a fancy name, by reason of the spelling,
and we have only to be grateful that the author did not inflict on us
the customary alliteration in her pseudonyme. The rare gift of delineating
childhood is hers, and may the line of 'Little Prudy' go out to the end of
the earth.... To those oversaturated with transatlantic traditions, we
recommend a course of 'Little Prudy.'"</p></blockquote>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
